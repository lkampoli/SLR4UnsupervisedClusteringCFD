	abstract = {Traditional partition-based clustering algorithms, hard or fuzzy version of C-means, could not deal with high-dimensional data sets effectively as redundant features may impact the computation of distances and local spatial structures among patterns are rarely considered. High dimensionality of space gives rise to so-called concentration effect that is detrimental. In this paper, a novel locality preserving based fuzzy C-means (LPFCM) clustering method and its optimization are presented. An orthogonally projected space, which preserves the locality of structural properties, can be generated in LPFCM, thus enhancing the capability of fuzzy C-means (FCM) for handling high-dimensional data. It is the first time to introduce projection techniques to the FCM optimization objective function directly, and the ideas of fuzzy clustering, geometric structure preservation and feature extraction are seamlessly integrated. LPFCM is also regarded as a unified model that combines two separate stages of spectral clustering. Experimental results on some benchmark data sets show the effectiveness of LPFCM in comparison with FCM and some state-of-the-art methods. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {In this digital world, we are facing the flood of data, but depriving for knowledge. The eminent need of mining is useful to extract the hidden pattern from the wide availability of vast amount of data. Clustering is one such useful mining tool to handle this unfavorable situation by carrying out crucial steps refers as cluster analysis. It is the process of a grouping of patterns into clusters based on similarity. Partition based clustering algorithms are widely accepted for much diverse application such as pattern analysis, image segmentation, identification system. Among the different variations of the partition based clustering, due to its monotony and ease of implementation K-means algorithm gained a lot of attraction in the various field of research. A severe problem associated with the algorithm is that it is highly sophisticated while selecting the initial centroid and may converge to a local optimum solution of the criterion function value if the initial centroid is not chosen accurately. Additionally, it requires the prior information regarding a number of clusters to be formed and the computation of K-means are expensive. K-means algorithm is a two-step process includes initialization and assignment step. This paper works on initialization step of the algorithm and proposed an efficient enhanced K-means clustering algorithm which eliminates the deficiency of the existing one. A new initialization approach has been introduced in the paper to drawn an initial cluster centers for K means Algorithm. The paper also compares proposed technique with K-means technique. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Clustering technique is one of the most important tools for knowledge discovery, during which the samples are divided into categories whose members are similar to each other. One of the most common and widely-used clustering solutions is partition-based clustering algorithms such as K-Means and K-Medoids which have attracted a lot of attention in the field of customer clustering. However, in these algorithms, the initial cluster centroids are usually randomly selected from the initial samples, making the final result of the clustering undesirable in most cases. In this research, a solution is proposed for the optimal selection of initial cluster centroids in K-Means algorithm. In the proposed method, the initial cluster centroids are selected based on a heuristic method to provide the input for the clustering algorithm. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, the K-Means, K-Medoids, and improved K-Means algorithms were tested on a real data set obtained from Central Insurance Company in Iran. According to standard evaluation criteria, the proposed method had a greater impact on improving clustering results than the other two methods. © 2005 – ongoing JATIT & LLS.},

	abstract = {This paper represents an implementation of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on masked and non-masked face recognition. Security is an essential term in our today's life. In various Biometric technology, face recognition is widely used to secure any system because it is better than any other traditional techniques like PIN, password, fingerprint etc. and most reliable to identify or verify a person efficiently. In recent years, face recognition is a very challenging task because of different occlusion or masks like the existence of sunglasses, scarves, hats and different types of make-up or disguise ingredients. The accuracy rate of face recognition is influenced by these types of masks. Many algorithms have been developed recently for non-masked face recognition which are widely used and give better performance. Still in the field of masked face recognition, few contributions has been done. Therefore, in this work a statistical procedure has been selected which is applied in non-masked face recognition and also apply in the masked face recognition technique. PCA is more effective and successful statistical technique and widely used. For this reason in this work, PCA algorithm has been chosen. Finally, a comparative study also done here for a better understanding. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Clustering is the process of grouping the data based on their similar properties. Meanwhile, it is the categorization of a set of data into similar groups (clusters), and the elements in each cluster share similarities, where the similarity between elements in the same cluster must be smaller enough to the similarity between elements of different clusters. Hence, this similarity can be considered as a distance measure. One of the most popular clustering algorithms is K-means, where distance is measured between every point of the dataset and centroids of clusters to find similar data objects and assign them to the nearest cluster. Further, there are a series of distance metrics that can be applied to calculate point-to-point distances. In this research, the K-means clustering algorithm is evaluated with three different mathematical metrics in terms of execution time with different datasets and different numbers of clusters. The results indicate that the implementation of Manhattan distance measure metrics achieves the best results in most cases. These results also demonstrate that distance metrics can affect the execution time and the number of clusters created by the K-means algorithm. © 2021, Tech Science Press. All rights reserved.},

Out of the total data produced through various digital devices, image data occupies a large section. Devices can create images in different formats such as monochrome, gray-scale, and color. Color images again can have different color models out of which the red green blue (RGB) model is one of the most widely used models. The total number of colors that can be present in an RGB color image can be as high as 224 = 16777216. All devices may not be able to efficiently process these high numbers of colors and most importantly, all these colors may not be of much significance from the perspective of human vision or various types of applications. In this paper, we have used partition-based clustering algorithms such as K-Means++, K-Medoids, Fuzzy-C Means, and Self-Organizing Maps to reduce the number of colors in RGB images from 16777216 to as small as 512 (i.e from 224 to 29) colors.

	abstract = {Offshore wind turbine (OWT) installations are continually expanding as they are considered an efficient mechanism for covering a part of the energy consumption requirements. The assessment of the energy potential of OWTs for specific offshore sites is the key factor that defines their successful implementation, commercialization and sustainability. The data used for this assessment mainly refer to wind speed measurements. However, the data may not present homogeneity due to incomplete or missing entries; this in turn, is attributed to failures of the measuring devices or other factors. This fact may lead to considerable limitations in the OWTs energy potential assessment. This paper presents two novel methodologies to handle the problem of incomplete and missing data. Computational intelligence algorithms are utilized for the filling of the incomplete and missing data in order to build complete wind speed series. Finally, the complete wind speed series are used for assessing the energy potential of an OWT in a specific offshore site. In many real-world metering systems, due to meter failures, incomplete and missing data are frequently observed, leading to the need for robust data handling. The novelty of the paper can be summarized in the following points: (i) a comparison of clustering algorithms for extracting typical wind speed curves is presented for the OWT related literature and (ii) two efficient novel methods for missing and incomplete data are proposed. © 2019 by the authors.

	abstract = {In this work, we propose an unsupervised multiple parametric-margin support vector clustering (MPMSVC) for noisy clustering tasks. The main idea of MPMSVC is to find a parametric-margin center hyperplane for each cluster in a manner that gathers the within-cluster instances around the corresponding center hyperplane, and keeps the between-cluster instances far away. Specifically, our MPMSVC owns the following attractive merits: i) The primal of MPMSVC is enhanced in the least squares sense, which enjoys an effective learning procedure. ii) The utilization of the linear L_{1} -norm loss makes MPMSVC be more robust to noisy clustering tasks. iii) An efficient iterative algorithm is presented to optimize the non-smooth problem in MPMSVC, which only involves a set of linear equations. Also, the convergence of the proposed algorithm is guaranteed theoretically. iv) The nonlinear extension is further derived via kernel technique to deal with more complex clustering tasks. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of MPMSVC is validated by extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets.  © 2013 IEEE.},

LiDAR produces highly accurate 3D point clouds, which are vital for the detection, classification, and tracking of multiple targets. A systematic review and classification of various clustering and Multi-Target Tracking (MTT) techniques are necessary due to the inherent challenges posed by LiDAR data, such as density, noise, and varying sampling rates. As part of this study, the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) methodology was employed to examine the challenges and advancements in MTT techniques and clustering for LiDAR point clouds within the context of autonomous driving. Searches were conducted in major databases such as IEEE Xplore, ScienceDirect, SpringerLink, ACM Digital Library, and Google Scholar, utilizing customized search strategies. We identified and critically reviewed 76 relevant studies based on rigorous screening and evaluation processes, assessing their methodological quality, data handling adequacy, and reporting compliance. As a result of this comprehensive review and classification, we were able to provide a detailed overview of current challenges, research gaps, and advancements in clustering and MTT techniques for LiDAR point clouds, thus contributing to the field of autonomous driving.

	abstract = {Big Data is the term that describes any voluminous amount of structured, semi-structured and unstructured data that has the potential to be mined for information. Clustering is an essential tool for clustering Big Data. Multi-machine clustering technique is one of the very efficient methods used in the Big Data to mine and analyse the data for insights. K-Means partition-based clustering algorithm is one of the clustering algorithm used to cluster Big Data. One of the main disadvantage of K-Means clustering algorithms is the deficiency in randomly identifying the K number of clusters and centroids. This results in more number of iterations and increased execution times to arrive at the optimal centroid. Sorting-based K-Means clustering algorithm (SBKMA) using multi-machine technique is another method for analysing Big Data. In this method, the data is sorted first using Hadoop MapReduce and mean is taken as centroids. This paper proposes a new algorithm called as SBKMEDA: Sorting-based K-Median clustering algorithm using multi-machine technique for Big Data to sort the data and replace median with mean as centroid for better accuracy and speed in forming the cluster. © 2018, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

Clustering techniques have been widely explored to reduce the conformations into manageable size. Clustering is the Artificial Intelligence based technique in which conformations are partitioned into clusters that exhibit similar behavior thus reducing the scanning cost. This paper analyzed two techniques Principal component analysis and K-means clustering to analyze the molecular simulation data. The clusters thus obtained are evaluated by using Average Silhouette Width and Calinski-Harabasz Index by considering varying number of clusters from 2 to 10 by varying Principal Components from 4 to 6.

In this study, partition around medoids (PAM) clustering algorithm is used to partition 105 Leeds community areas into four distinct groups based on their crime rates. Silhouette index and adjusted rand index (ARI) were used to evaluate the validity of clusters internally and externally. The new typology developed, has revealed new insights demonstrating the relationship between social cohesion and crime rates in Leeds community areas. The new partitioned clusters also provide area-based specific information, on criminal activities that could help in policy planning for community building and better resource allocation towards reducing crime rates. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

The devised method has four stages: 1) extracts the stamp image; 2) preprocessing the image; 3) feature extraction; and 4) matching. This paper is implemented using C sharp (Microsoft Visual Studio 2012) programming language. The experiments conducted on a stamp dataset showed that the proposed method has a great capability to recognize stamps when using Haar wavelet transform with two sets of features (i.e., 100% recognition rate for energy features and 99.93% recognition rate for low order moment). © 2021.

Var-ious clustering algorithms and cluster validity indexes have been proposed and improvised to obtain the best clustering result. However, there is no clustering method that is able to give consistent results on similar structure of a dataset. An alternative mechanism to control the variation of results and improved the quality of traditional clustering is through consensus clus-tering. In this paper, we generate multiple partitions of consensus clustering through a resampling method by employing q-fold cross-validation approach. q-fold cross-validation approach is able to speed-up the consensus partitions procedure with qth iterations. To encounter with different number of clus-ter labels occur in the partitions, we employed voting-based method in the second stage of consensus clustering to obtain optimal consensus partition.

The needed data must be accessible at any given point of time, in order to ensure data usability. However, data accessibility is highly challenging, due to the increased volume of data and the best solution to deal with this issue is data organization. Clustering is the best form of data organization, which groups the related entities together, while separating unrelated entities. Understanding the effectiveness of data clustering, this article presents a twinned text clustering algorithm based on Improved Density Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (IDBSCAN), which is an enhanced version of DBSCAN and the ConceptNet. The roughly formed clusters are refined by the sense based ConceptNet, which improves the performance of the clustering. The performance of this work is compared with recent existing approaches in terms of F-measure, purity and entropy. The proposed twinned clustering algorithm exhibits better F-measure and purity rates with minimal entropy rates. © 2020 Alpha Publishers. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The K-means algorithm is a widely used clustering algorithm that offers simplicity and efficiency. However, the traditional K-means algorithm uses a random method to determine the initial cluster centers, which make clustering results prone to local optima and then result in worse clustering performance. In this research, we propose an adaptive initialization method for the K-means algorithm (AIMK) which can adapt to the various characteristics in different datasets and obtain better clustering performance with stable results. For larger or higher-dimensional datasets, we even leverage random sampling in AIMK (name as AIMK-RS) to reduce the time complexity. 22 real-world datasets were applied for performance comparisons. The experimental results show AIMK and AIMK-RS outperform the current initialization methods and several well-known clustering algorithms. Specifically, AIMK-RS can significantly reduce the time complexity to O (n). Moreover, we exploit AIMK to initialize K-medoids and spectral clustering, and better performance is also explored. The above results demonstrate superior performance and good scalability by AIMK or AIMK-RS. In the future, we would like to apply AIMK to more partition-based clustering algorithms to solve real-life practical problems. Copyright © 2021 Yang, Wang, Yao and Lin.},

	abstract = {The influx of data in bioinformatics is primarily in the form of DNA, RNA, and protein sequences. This condition places a significant burden on scientists and computers. Some genomics studies depend on clustering techniques to group similarly expressed genes into one cluster. Clustering is a type of unsupervised learning that can be used to divide unknown cluster data into clusters. The k-means and fuzzy c-means (FCM) algorithms are examples of algorithms that can be used for clustering. Consequently, clustering is a common approach that divides an input space into several homogeneous zones; it can be achieved using a variety of algorithms. This study used three models to cluster a brain tumor dataset. The first model uses FCM, which is used to cluster genes. FCM allows an object to belong to two or more clusters with a membership grade between zero and one and the sum of belonging to all clusters of each gene is equal to one. This paradigm is useful when dealing with microarray data. The total time required to implement the first model is 22.2589 s. The second model combines FCM and particle swarm optimization (PSO) to obtain better results. The hybrid algorithm, i.e., FCM– PSO, uses the DB index as objective function. The experimental results show that the proposed hybrid FCM–PSO method is effective. The total time of implementation of this model is 89.6087 s. The third model combines FCM with a genetic algorithm (GA) to obtain better results. This hybrid algorithm also uses the DB index as objective function. The experimental results show that the proposed hybrid FCM–GA method is effective. Its total time of implementation is 50.8021 s. In addition, this study uses cluster validity indexes to determine the best partitioning for the underlying data. Internal validity indexes include the Jaccard, Davies Bouldin, Dunn, Xie–Beni, and silhouette. Meanwhile, external validity indexes include Minkowski, adjusted Rand, and percentage of correctly categorized pairings. Experiments conducted on brain tumor gene expression data demonstrate that the techniques used in this study outperform traditional models in terms of stability and biological significance. © 2022 Autoctonía.

	abstract = {Augmented reality (AR) has proven to be an invaluable interactive medium to reduce cognitive load by bridging the gap between the task-at-hand and relevant information by displaying information without disturbing the user's focus. AR is particularly useful in the manufacturing environment where a diverse set of tasks such as assembly and maintenance must be performed in the most cost-effective and efficient manner possible. While AR systems have seen immense research innovation in recent years, the current strategies utilised in AR for camera calibration, detection, tracking, camera position and orientation (pose) estimation, inverse rendering, procedure storage, virtual object creation, registration, and rendering are still mostly dominated by traditional non-AI approaches. This restricts their practicability to controlled environments with limited variations in the scene. Classical AR methods can be greatly improved through the incorporation of various AI strategies like deep learning, ontology, and expert systems for adapting to broader scene variations and user preferences. This research work provides a review of current AR strategies, critical appraisal for these strategies, and potential AI solutions for every component of the computational pipeline of AR systems. Given the review of current work in both fields, future research work directions are also outlined. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

A cluster constitutes a set regarding entities that are alike and entities from different clusters are not alike. Representing data by fewer clusters inevitably loses certain fine important information but achieves better simplification. There is no training stage in clustering; mostly, it's used when the classes are not well-known. Bayesian network is one of the best classification methods and is frequently used. Generally, Bayesian network is a form of graphical probabilistic representation model that consists of a set of interconnected nodes, where each node represents a variable, and inter-link connection represents a causal relationship of those variables. Belief networks are graph symbolized models that successfully model familiarity via transmitting probabilistic information to a variety of assumptions. © 2020, IGI Global.},

	abstract = {With the development of web service technology, identifying and discovering the users with similar preferences have an important significance to service selection and service optimization in the service environment. In order to divide the users into groups based on their preference similarity in the process of service selection, a combination-based clustering algorithm, named AAK, is presented in this paper. The method combines the K-means algorithm with the Affinity Propagation (AP) algorithm to cluster the users with similar preferences. In the clustering process, the algorithm makes full use of the advantages of the two algorithms, including the high partition accuracy of K-means algorithm and the independence in the prior knowledge of AP algorithm, which breaks the limitation of using a single clustering algorithm. Then a parallel execution model of the algorithm is built and implemented by a high order MapReduce sequence linking technology. Finally AAK algorithm is compared with its serial model and the other combination-based clustering methods on Matlab platform and Hadoop platform. The experimental results show that AAK algorithm can be applied to distinguish user group with different preferences and has a good effectiveness and efficiency. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The blast furnace operation profile is closely related to the operation, technical and economic indicators of a blast furnace. A reasonable furnace operation profile ensures high-quality hot metal, low fuel consumption, high yield, and furnace longevity. To guide the blast furnace ironmaking, cluster analysis of the stave temperature is implemented to effectively characterize the changes in the furnace operation profile. The K-Means, TwoStep, and hierarchical clustering algorithms are often used to monitor the blast furnace operation profile. The present study also shows that various clustering algorithms can help manage the blast furnace operation profile. However, the difference among the clustering results from these algorithms remains unclear. Based on the previous research, this paper compared the clustering principles and research status with various algorithms and selected two algorithms of K-Means and TwoStep, which were more applicable and compatible with the algorithm principles. The K-Means algorithm is a typical partition-based clustering algorithm with low time complexity, high clustering efficiency, and good clustering quality. It has been widely used in cluster analysis of the blast furnace operation profile. Additionally, domestic scholars had given effective improvement measures for the shortcomings of sensitivity to the initial center and requirements for data distribution. The TwoStep algorithm was an improved BIRCH (Balanced iterative reducing and clustering using hierarchies) algorithm, which reduced time complexity and can automatically determine the optimal number of clusters. The authors of this article considered the problem that indicators for evaluating the furnace operation profile were multiple and largely overlapped. Principal Component Analysis was introduced based on the TwoStep algorithm. Three new core indicators were generated from the traditional evaluation indicators for the clustering results of the furnace operation profile. For blast furnace operation profile monitoring and management, three core indicators also showed improved performance. In this paper, K-Means and TwoStep were used to cluster the data set. Based on the principles of these algorithms and combined with the Davies−Bouldin index and Dunn index, the clustering results were analyzed to judge the difference between the two clustering algorithms. The analysis based on the sample data and data characteristics selected in this article revealed that the K-Means algorithm achieved better clustering results than TwoStep. This research can provide a powerful reference for selection among various clustering algorithms in blast furnace ironmaking big data analysis. © 2022 Science Press. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Clustering, or cluster analysis, is an important unsupervised task in machine learning that determines how the observed data naturally clusters. Many efficient traditional clustering methods based on different behaviours, such as partitioning' hierarchical, grid, model, and density based, have been proposed in recent decades. However, clustering itself is considered an NP-hard problem, and it becomes more challenging when the clustered data is large. The classical clustering techniques cannot handle big data problems due to their large volume, fast generation, significant heterogeneity and complexity. Therefore, more effective, flexible, and efficient clustering approaches are required. Recently, the parallel and distributed computing concepts gives birth to the parallel clustering algorithms. Nowadays, the researches focus on scalable clustering methods based on different acceleration platforms to deal with big data problems. The acceleration platforms can be classified into horizontal and vertical-scaling platforms. In this paper we present a recent overview of the latest parallel and distributed clustering algorithms based on vertical scaling platforms. Otherwise, the paper gives a discussion that will be useful for researchers to propose more effective and efficient algorithms for Big Data clustering.  © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Clustering is an important technology for data analysis. Cluster analysis for mixed data remains challenging. This paper proposes a mixed data clustering algorithm with noise-filtered distribution centroid and iterative weight adjustment strategy. The proposed algorithm defines noise-filtered distribution centroid for categorical attributes. We combine both mean and noise-filtered distribution centroid to represent the cluster center with mixed attributes, the noise-filtered distribution centroid records the frequency of occurrences for each possible value of the categorical attributes in a cluster more accurately. Furthermore, because the “noise values” are filtered, the measure to calculate the dissimilarity between data objects and cluster centers could be improved. In addition, the algorithm introduces an iterative weight adjustment strategy with combined intra-cluster and inter-cluster information. The unified weight measurement method is used for refining numeric attributes and categorical attributes. Then attributes with higher intra-cluster homogeneity and inter-clusters heterogeneity are considered as attributes with higher priority. They tend to be assigned with relatively heavier weights during clustering. Experimental results on different datasets from the UCI repository show that the MCFCIW algorithm outperforms the existing partition-based clustering algorithm and clustering algorithm based on data conversion for mixed data on both cluster validity indices and convergence speed. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.},

The research was conducted on a sample of 500 adults purchasing PLs using quota selection and the CAWI method. We formulated four research questions related to factors of PL choice, the relationship between frequency of PL purchases, consumers’ age and income, perceived changes in PLs, and evaluation of PL products including sustainability. The latter research question referred to such product characteristics as local and environmentally friendly production, organic production, and production according to traditional technologies using only natural ingredients. For a detailed analysis of consumer behavior, we used Pearson’s chi-square test, the rho-Spearman correlation coefficient, and cluster analysis. The most important factors for purchasing PL products were lower prices compared to leading brands, attachment to a given chain, and the feeling of safety and trust in PL products. The frequency of purchase of PL food products, except for alcohol, significantly negatively correlates with age, which means that the purchase of PLs from the analyzed product categories decreases with age. The increased availability and improved image and quality of PLs were identified as the most important changes in PLs. PL food products were rated by consumers as fresh, minimally processed and with quality certificates. Environmentally friendly production methods, nutritional value, and origin from an area close to home were also indicated. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

The methods for anomaly detection are designed to detect object's deviations from normal behavior. However, it is difficult to select one tool for all types of anomalies due to the increasing computational complexity and the nature of the data. In this paper, an improved optimization approach for a previously known number of clusters, where a weight is assigned to each data point, is proposed. The aim of this article is to show that weighting of each data point improves the clustering solution. The experimental results on three datasets show that the proposed algorithm detects anomalies more accurately. It was compared to the k-means algorithm. The quality of the clustering result was estimated using clustering evaluation metrics.

A research approach is presented to evaluate the application potential of selected methods via a holistic framework including three main evaluation milestones: the determination of optimal number of clusters, the main clustering application, and the performance evaluation. Hence, quantified Term Document Matrices are initially pre-processed and afterwards used as underlying databases to investigate the pattern recognition potential of clustering techniques by considering the information regarding the optimal number of clusters and by measuring the respective internal as well as external performances.

The cluster numbers obtained from K-means clustering are assigned as class labels for the samples and the dataset is converted into a labelled dataset. Popular individual classifiers and ensemble classifiers are used to classify the samples present in the labelled dataset. In this study, bagging with decision tree classifier achieved the best classification accuracy of 97.95%. The study further analyses the attributes in the dataset using visualisation techniques to draw inferences by performing small transformations on them. The proposed system will be useful to understand traveller satisfaction and as a tourist spot recommendation system. © 2022 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

	abstract = {Clustering is a very useful machine learning technique to find the underlying classification of unlabeled data. In computational biology, clustering techniques are extensively used to identify a group of biomolecules responsible for biological activity in animals. There are several types of knowledge acquisition techniques are used in Clustering analysis. Most of them are work best for a particular data type. Now, it is very difficult for researchers to choose appropriate clustering technique for a specific dataset. Therefore, we present a comprehensive comparative analysis of broadly classified clustering techniques over the biological dataset. Here we consider 4 types of datasets for our experiment. As a result of this comparative analysis, we found that using the partition base algorithm on all the data, the K-means clustering algorithm is giving the better results and in the case of the non-partition base algorithm, the Hierarchical clustering algorithm using complete linkage method is giving the better results than others. This study will further help us to find more efficient clustering technique that works well with all type of biological $dataset$. © 2020 IEEE.},

It performs activities like pattern representation, using of clustering algorithms and their validation, data abstraction and finally result generated. Clustering has many categories of algorithms such as partition-based, hierarchical-based, density-based, grid-based etc. Partition-based is the centroid-based clustering. Hierarchical-based clustering is link-based. Density-based is clustering is focused on area of higher density in the dataset. Grid-based clustering relies on size of the grid. In this paper, we discussed different clustering techniques as well as, a detailed review on the partition-based and hierarchical-based algorithms. Finally we compare clustering algorithms on the basis of attributes like time complexity, capacity of handling large datasets, scalability, sensitivity to outliers and noise, and also discussed result after solving a particular dataset implemented in cloud computing environment. © 2018 Authors.},

Divides data of interest into a relatively small number of or homogeneous groups, this technology is used in many applications. One reason it's so frequently used is that it can work on a dataset without prior knowledge. This is why clustering is feasible for real-world applications. Gene expression data have been clustered and shown to help reveal the normal structure of the data, cellular processes, gene functions, extracting valuable information from occult data. Info on gene expression hides crucial information, because of the intricacy of biological networks and the huge number of genes involved. Therefore, clustering strategies are the top step in addressing these issues, and they are needed to identify interesting patterns and to scout natural structures in the underlying data. The discovery of homology is another advantage of data on gene expression clustering. This review looks at the different clustering algorithms applied to analyze gene code trim to discover, and supply valuable information about the best clustering strategy for ensuring consistency and precision in the research process.  © 2023 Author(s).},

	abstract = {Density peaks clustering (DPC) algorithm is an efficient and simple clustering method attracting the attention of many researchers. However, its strategy of assigning each non-grouped object to the same cluster depends on its nearest neighbors having a higher local density. This may lead to the cluster label error propagation problem, i.e. if an object is wrong-labeled during the clustering process, its label will be propagated in the subsequent assignment. To overcome this defect, in this paper we propose a three-way density peak clustering method based on evidence theory, referred to as 3W-DPET. 3W-DPET forms clusters as interval sets using three-way clustering representation including three disjoint regions called positive region (POS), boundary region (BND) and negative region (NEG). 3W-DPET mainly consists of three steps: (1) finding out cluster centers and noises before clustering; (2) using a midrange distance comparison method to detect positive regions of clusters; and (3) allocating the remaining non-grouped objects, including noises, to the boundary region or the negative region of clusters. The distinguishing feature of 3W-DPET is that evidence theory is used to construct and collect the information of K-nearest neighbors in order to assign non-grouped objects to the most suitable cluster, which can effectively solve the problem of cluster label error propagation. In order to validate 3W-DPET, we test it on 18 datasets using three benchmarks (ACC, ARI and NMI), and compare it to K-means, FCM, DPC, KNN-DPC, DPCSA, SNN-DPC and CE3-kmeans methods. Experimental results suggest that 3W-DPET can effectively find clusters and its results conform with human cognition. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

Now a days various biometric feature like fingerprint, gait, iris, face etc. are used to secure any system and it is more powerful to use biometric feature instead of using other traditional techniques like password, PIN number etc. In automated personal identification system iris recognition technique is the most reliable authentication technique and iris image segmentation step is important to acquire good accuracy in this technique. But noisy image decrease the accuracy and most of the errors occur in non-iris region. So it is better to avoid segmentation errors by excluding non-iris regions from iris image. On the other hand cluster analysis one of the data mining concepts, is very useful for finding similar groups from a data set. So cluster analysis can be used for finding relevant groups from iris image. Basically k-means clustering algorithm used on segmentation step. In this thesis work another two clustering algorithms has been used for iris image preprocessing on segmentation step to cluster most similar objects together so that non-iris region can be reduced and compare their performance with k-means algorithm to find out the better one. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Conventional textual documents clustering algorithms suffer from several shortcomings, such as the slow convergence of the immense high-dimensional data, the sensitivity to the initial value, and the understandability of the description of the resulted clusters. Although many clustering algorithms have been developed for English and other languages, very few have tackled the problem of clustering the under-resourced Arabic language. In this work, we propose a modified version of the Bond Energy Algorithm (BEA) combined with a fuzzy merging technique to solve the problem of Arabic text document clustering. The proposed algorithm, Clustering Arabic Documents based on Bond Energy, hereafter named CADBE, attempts to identify and display natural variable clusters within huge sized data. CADBE has three steps to cluster Arabic documents: the first step instantiates a cluster affinity matrix using the BEA, the second step uses a new and novel method to partition the cluster matrix automatically into small coherent clusters, and the last step uses a fuzzy merging technique to merge similar clusters based on the associations and interrelations between the resulted clusters. Experimental results showed that the proposed algorithm effectively outperformed the conventional clustering algorithms such as Expectation–Maximization (EM), Single Linkage, and UPGMA in terms of clustering purity and entropy. It also outperformed k-means, k-means++, spherical k-means, and CoclusMod in most test cases. However, there are several merits of CADBE. First, unlike the traditional clustering algorithms, it does not require to specify the number of clusters. In addition, it produces clusters with distinct boundaries, which makes its results more objective, and finally it is deterministic, such that it is insensitive to the order in which documents are presented to the algorithm. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The vast and diversified text materials on the internet in recent years have drastically increased the importance of information mining. By organizing documents into cohesive groupings, a document clustering method is a suitable tool for dealing with massive amounts of documents. Text documents, on the other hand, include sparse and uninformative features like noise, unrelated, and unneeded features, which reduce the efficiency of the document clustering methods. For noise removal, this work employs the hyperclique pattern-based data cleaner pre-processing approach. Then, differential bond energy algorithm (DBEA) is combined with a fuzzy merging approach and termed improved differential bond energy algorithm with fuzzy merging (IDBEFM) to handle the issues present in text document clustering. It seeks to discover and display natural variable clusters among large amounts of data. IDBEFM clusters are documented in three steps: in the first step, a cluster similarity matrix is instantiated by applying the DBEA. The second step develops an innovative technique for automatically dividing the cluster matrix into compact cohesive clusters, and in the third step, a fuzzy merging approach is used for combining identical clusters by the correlations and interrelationships between the resultant clusters. The test findings demonstrated that the accomplishment of the proposed technique is much superior to standard clustering algorithms. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Software testing has a significant importance to achieve maximum quality to satisfy the customers and concerned stakeholders. A test case is designed to perform set of actions with intend of finding errors and verify some functions and features of an application. During design process, a huge number of test cases produced, some of them are of little or no use, which can be ignore or postponed, when there is budget and time constraints, or a need to decide which test cases to execute first and which to last. However, in black box testing, test cases are prioritized manually during planning phase and companies mostly experience schedule limitations, in that case, effective testing costs them badly. Test case prioritization's main purpose is to effectively use time and budget to execute highest priority test cases first with customer's satisfaction. To achieve this goal, we proposed a technique in which we use a customer assigned weight abstracted from business requirements to keep the customer's preference first, based on that three main clusters formed. Then we calculate proposed cost and time percentage for each test case using function points and complexity measure, with in each cluster. Based on that, clusters further classified in to High, Medium and Low priorities clusters by K-Medoids algorithm. In our approach, test cases finally classified in to clusters and sub clusters based on the priority of the both stakeholders. Our approach shows 79.174% accuracy as compared to the actual data. To achieve maximum efficiency, considering user's satisfaction, this method of mining test cases will be helpful in terms of saving time and cost. © 2019 IEEE.},

Capturing the emotions expressed in the written language could be crucial to support the decision-making processes: the emotion resulting from a tweet or a review about an item could affect the way to advertise or to trade on the web and then to make predictions about future changes in popularity or market behavior. This paper presents an experience with the emotion-based classification of textual data from a social network by using an extended version of the fuzzy C-means algorithm called extension of fuzzy C-means. The algorithm shows interesting results due to its intrinsic fuzzy nature that reflects the human feeling expressed in the text, often composed of a mix of blurred emotions, and at the same time, the benefits of the extended version yield better classification results. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {One of the important trends in an intelligent data analysis will be the growing importance of data processing. But this point faces problems similar to those of data mining (i.e., high-dimensional data, missing value imputation and data integration); one of the challenges in estimation missing value methods is how to select the optimal number of nearest neighbors of those values. This paper, attempting to search the capability of building a novel tool to estimate missing values of various datasets called developed random forest and local least squares (DRFLLS). By developing random forest algorithm, seven categories of similarity measures were defined. These categories are person similarity coefficient, simple similarity, and fuzzy similarity (M1, M2, M3, M4 and M5). They are sufficient to estimate the optimal number of neighborhoods of missing values in this application. Hereafter, local least squares (LLS) has been used to estimate the missing values. Imputation accuracy can be measured in different ways: Pearson correlation (PC) and NRMSE. Then, the optimal number of neighborhoods is associated with the highest value of PC and a smaller value of NRMSE. The experimental results were carried out on six datasets obtained from different disciplines, and DRFLLS proves the dataset which has a small rate of missing values gave the best estimation to the number of nearest neighbors by DRFPC and in the second degree by DRFFSM1 when r = 4, while if the dataset has high rate of missing values, then it gave the best estimation to number of nearest neighbors by DRFFSM5 and in the second degree by DRFFSM3. After that, the missing value was estimated by LLS, and the results accuracy was measured by NRMSE and Pearson correlation. The smallest value of NRMSE for a given dataset is corresponding to DRF correlation function which is a better function for a given dataset. The highest value of PC for a given dataset is corresponding to DRF correlation function which is a better function for a given dataset. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Earth Observation (EO) data is a source of a wide range of information, in vegetation, oceanography, land use, land cover and many more applications. To uncover the hidden information in the data, unsupervised learning techniques like clustering is used popularly. With technological advancements, the amount of data received through satellites rises exponentially, possessing the properties of Big Data. Traditional implementations of clustering algorithms have processing limitations based on the memory capability of the system. In general, applying any clustering algorithm directly to the large EO raster data requires a considerably large amount of time, due to the spatio-temporal nature of the data. The data generated by remote sensors have significant redundant values, so we have made an attempt to use compressed raster data for clustering without decompressing it. In this work, we present the compact data structure, known as k2-raster, based technique for clustering raster data. k2-raster preserves the spatial context in the image and provides time efficient and lossless compression. We have applied this technique to OCM2-NDVI, in GeoTIFF format, single and stacked image to develop a compressed dataset for efficient representation. As partition based clustering algorithms are widely used in clustering EO data because of their simplicity and time efficiency, we have examined the results on k-means and mini-batch k-means. We have also assessed the performance of our algorithm on model based clustering algorithms. It has been demonstrated that, for datasets with larger numbers of raster values, the developed compact data structure based approach works very well in terms of compact representation of data as well as, with both the partition based and model based clustering techniques making the clustering scalable. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Text clustering is one of the most commonly used methods for detecting themes or types of documents. Text clustering is used in many fields, but its effectiveness is still not sufficient to be used for the understanding of Arabic text, especially with respect to terms extraction, unsupervised feature selection, and clustering algorithms. In most cases, terms extraction focuses on nouns. Clustering simplifies the understanding of an Arabic text like the text of the Quran; it is important not only for Muslims but for all people who want to know more about Islam. This paper discusses the complexity and limitations of Arabic text clustering in the Quran based on their themes. Unsupervised feature selection does not consider the relationships between the selected features. One weakness of clustering algorithms is that the selection of the optimal initial centroid still depends on chances and manual settings. Consequently, this paper reviews literature about the three major stages of Arabic clustering: terms extraction, unsupervised feature selection, and clustering. Six experiments were conducted to demonstrate previously un-discussed problems related to the metrics used for feature selection and clustering. Suggestions to improve clustering of the Quran based on themes are presented and discussed. © Qusay Bsoul, Rosalina Abdul Salam, Jaffar Atwan, Malik Jawarneh, 2021},

The gestational diabetes occurs for pregnant women. According to the statistical report of WHO 79% of deaths occurred in people under the age of 60, due to diabetes. With a specific end goal to deal with the vast volume, speed, assortment, veracity and estimation of information a scalable environment is needed. Cloud computing is an interesting computing model suitable for accommodating huge volume of dynamic data. To overcome the data handling problems this work focused on Hadoop framework along with clustering technique. This work also predicts the occurrence of diabetes under various circumstances which is more useful for the human. This paper also compares the efficiency of two different clustering techniques suitable for the environment.

Some of the methods for detection of outlier are: Distance based method, Distribution based method, Density based method and Clustering based method. In this research, clustering based method is used for outlying items. The purpose of this study is to detect outlier in multivariate data by performing cluster analysis. The K means and Partitioning Around Medoid (PAM) methods were performed. After cluster the data outliers are detected by measuring distance. The comparison of the clustering techniques in outlier detection methods are analyzed. The secondary data was used for analysis.

	abstract = {Context: Inappropriate public disclosure of security bug reports (SBRs) is likely to attract malicious attackers to invade software systems; hence being able to detect SBRs has become increasingly important for software maintenance. Due to the class imbalance problem that the number of non-security bug reports (NSBRs) exceeds the number of SBRs, insufficient training information, and weak performance robustness, the existing techniques for identifying SBRs are still less than desirable. Objective: This prompted us to overcome the challenges of the most advanced SBR detection methods. Method: In this work, we propose the CASMS approach to efficiently alleviate the imbalance problem and predict bug reports. CASMS first converts bug reports into weighted word embeddings based on tf−idf and word2vec techniques. Unlike the previous studies selecting the NSBRs that are the most dissimilar to SBRs, CASMS then automatically finds a certain number of diverse NSBRs via the Elbow method and k-means clustering algorithm. Finally, the selected NSBRs and all SBRs train an effective Attention CNN–BLSTM model to extract contextual and sequential information. Results: The experimental results have shown that CASMS is superior to the three baselines (i.e., FARSEC, SMOTUNED, and LTRWES) in assessing the overall performance (g-measure) and correctly identifying SBRs (recall), with improvements of 4.09%–24.26% and 10.33%–36.24%, respectively. The best results are easily obtained under the limited ratio ranges of the two-class training set (1:1 to 3:1), with around 20 experiments for each project. By evaluating the robustness of CASMS via the standard deviation indicator, CASMS is more stable than LTRWES. Conclusion: Overall, CASMS can alleviate the data imbalance problem and extract more semantic information to improve performance and robustness. Therefore, CASMS is recommended as a practical approach for identifying SBRs. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

The latter data set, which was obtained from the Ministry of Tourism and Sports of Thailand that regularly collects unlabeled data, mandated the synthesis of tourism form labels to be usable for classification. To achieve such a label synthesis, we proposed a cluster-to-class mapping algorithm that consisted of three steps. First, searching the best tourist clustering model among the unlabeled tourist data set by comparing the results of K-means, hierarchical cluster analysis, random clustering, and DBSCAN techniques. Second, mapping the clusters to the classes of the labeled data set based on Euclidean similarity to reveal the tourism form labels for the clusters. Finally, searching the best tourism-form classification model based on the data sets with real and synthesized labels by engaging Naïve Bayes, support vector machine, linear regression, and decision tree techniques. Experimental results show that our algorithm effectively generated the tourism form labels since, when using them, we obtained a neutral network model that was capable of predicting the inbound tourism forms of an unseen tourist data set with an F-measure value as high as 98.99%. © 2021, King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang.

	abstract = {Agriculture is an important and vital sector in Iran’s economy. This sector provides basic needs along with undesirable outputs such as greenhouse gases. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are main causes of environmental pollution. By considering the pollution in production process, economic performance can be evaluated precisely. We can modify the efficiency model using the desirable and undesirable outputs to improve the quality of the environment, and to achieve sustainable development. In this regard, environmental efficiency of agriculture is an appropriate guide to produce crops using low inputs and environmental pollution. This study aims to estimate the agricultural environmental efficiency in Iran’s different provinces using data envelopment analysis (DEA) method. The results show that for each billion Rial of agriculture gross value added, 11.39 tons of carbon dioxide are produced. Subsequently, regarding the greenhouse gas emissions caused by proportional agricultural activity, the provinces are divided into three clusters. Mean carbon dioxide emission for each cluster is 536,663.7, 804,315.7, and 186,311.8 tons, respectively. Mean environmental efficiency for clusters is 0.294, 0.243, and 0.836, respectively. This indicates that provinces with more greenhouse gas emissions have lower environmental efficiency. In this regard, the politicians should make the less efficient clusters to reduce the use of undesirable inputs to decrease the pollutant emissions. Besides, by proper allocation of capital, the more efficient cluster can improve environmental technologies. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

It can provide as a starting place of individual data to learn the physical condition of users. OBJECTIVES: Key objective is to develop graph-based algorithm to detect public health in online social network. METHODS: The proposed method collect the tweets relating to general health in twitter using the min-cut algorithm. The algorithm finds the minimum cut off an undirected edge-weighted graph. The runtime of the algorithm seems to be faster than other graph algorithms. Min-cut is reliable and good in network optimization and prevents redundancy. RESULTS: To evaluate the performance, we utilize the health dataset on the detection of epidemic disease. The proposed method using a graph-based algorithm is the best in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall. With respect to the confusion matrix, Min-cut provides the highest true positive when compared to Text rank and K-Means algorithm. CONCLUSION: Proposed health detection method using graph-based algorithm is better than Text Rank and K-Means in all aspects. © 2019 R.Devika et al.},

This paper aims therefore to introduce a novel mathematical approach to segment passenger vehicles based on dimensions features using a means fuzzy clustering algorithm, Fuzzy C-means (FCM), and a non-fuzzy clustering algorithm, K-means (KM). We analyze the performance of the proposed algorithms and compare them with Swiss expert segmentation. Experiments on the real data sets demonstrate that the FCM classifier has better correlation with the expert segmentation than KM. Furthermore, the outputs from FCM with five clusters show that the proposed algorithm has a superior performance for accurate vehicle categorization because of its capacity to recognize and consolidate dimension attributes from the unsupervised data set. Its performance in categorizing vehicles was promising with an average accuracy rate of 79% and an average positive predictive value of 75%. © National Academy of Sciences: Transportation Research Board 2021.},

	abstract = {Motivation Many real applications such as businesses and health generate large categorical datasets with uncertainty. A fundamental task is to efficiently discover hidden and non-trivial patterns from such large uncertain categorical datasets. Since the exact value of an attribute is often unknown in uncertain categorical datasets, conventional clustering analysis algorithms do not provide a suitable means for dealing with categorical data, uncertainty, and stability. Problem statement The ability of decision making in the presence of vagueness and uncertainty in data can be handled using Rough Set Theory. Though, recent categorical clustering techniques based on Rough Set Theory help but they suffer from low accuracy, high computational complexity, and generalizability especially on data sets where they sometimes fail or hardly select their best clustering attribute. Objectives The main objective of this research is to propose a new information theoretic based Rough Purity Approach (RPA). Another objective of this work is to handle the problems of traditional Rough Set Theory based categorical clustering techniques. Hence, the ultimate goal is to cluster uncertain categorical datasets efficiently in terms of the performance, generalizability and computational complexity. Methods The RPA takes into consideration information-theoretic attribute purity of the categorical-valued information systems. Several extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the efficiency of RPA using a real Supplier Base Management (SBM) and six benchmark UCI datasets. The proposed RPA is also compared with several recent categorical data clustering techniques. Results The experimental results show that RPA outperforms the baseline algorithms. The significant percentage improvement with respect to time (66.70%), iterations (83.13%), purity (10.53%), entropy (14%), and accuracy (12.15%) as well as Rough Accuracy of clusters show that RPA is suitable for practical usage. Conclusion We conclude that as compared to other techniques, the attribute purity of categorical-valued information systems can better cluster the data. Hence, RPA technique can be recommended for large scale clustering in multiple domains and its performance can be enhanced for further research. Copyright: © 2022 Uddin et al.

	abstract = {Clustering is a data analysis technique that divides information into numerous homogeneous groups. They are clustering algorithms like Centroid, Density-based Distribution and Hierarchical based Clustering. These algorithms provide better performance for only spherical clusters and acquire high-time complexity issues. So, a Belief-Peaks Evidential Clustering (BPEC) method is efficiently used to deal with non-spherical clusters and improve the clustering performance. However, if the number of clusters is too great, the complexity of BPEC becomes exorbitant. Motivated by these challenges, a hybrid of Fuzzy Label Propagation and Local Resultant Evidential Clustering Method (FLPLRECM) is proposed to handle the sparse and helps to form more precise clusters. Initially, to select Cluster Centres (CCs) based on data dispersion and local density, an adaptive CCs selection approach is proposed. This model provides a Symmetric Neighborhood Graph (SNG) to all Data Points (DPs) with other points along with the standard deviation (SD)/kurtosis, local densities of each point are computed by utilizing the reverse k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN). To deal with the high dimensional dataset, the Centrality (CE) and Coordination (CO) metrics are introduced to classify the DPs as interior points (ips), inner boundary points (ibps), boundary points (bps), or noise DPs for improving the cluster formation. The intensities and orientations of DPs near the fuzzy CCs and at the fuzzy cluster boundaries are assessed. First, a helpful initial fuzzy cluster assignment is made for each remaining point based on the distances between each CC and its neighbours. After then, neighbour's labels are used to refine each point's own till the fuzzy partition remains the same. The developed method will provide more precise clusters with less computational time, efficiently used for the analysis of the cancer detection system. © 2022 Seventh Sense Research Group.},

	abstract = {Ensembles of geological realizations (GR) are normally processed by numerical simulators to evaluate geological uncertainty during the decision-making process. Although different stochastic spatial algorithms can quickly generate hundreds to thousands of GR to capture the full uncertainty range, the simulation process applied to this number of realizations is computationally expensive. Hence, a small subset of representative geological realizations (RGR) that statistically represent the features of the full ensemble can be used for uncertainty quantification. In this study, unsupervised machine learning (UML) is applied by considering different (1) adjacency matrix construction, (2) dimensionality reduction, and (3) clustering and sampling algorithms to generate several RGR sets. Then, the mismatches between the distribution of different field and well indicators obtained from the RGR sets and the whole ensemble are measured using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test to compare the uncertainty space of the subsets and the full set. Furthermore, to measure the pairwise adjacency between the realizations, we use a static reservoir feature called reservoir quality index (RQI). We performed extensive computational analyses to appraise the performance of the UML in two benchmark cases. Each case contains 500 GR. This study can provide a comprehensive assessment of the UML for the RGR selection due to the application of different algorithms. The results showed that the RGR set can be successfully selected without previous flow simulation runs, if an appropriate UML method is employed. This leads to a reduction in the computational cost during uncertainty quantification and risk analysis. Furthermore, we observed that the optimal number of RGR should be chosen due to the geological complexity of each case study. We also found that the type of recovery mechanism has no impact on the optimal number of RGR and on UML methods. The appropriate RGR set can be used for production forecasts and development planning support. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

Data collection was performed by administering a questionnaire to Cluj-Napoca residents. The final sample consisted of two groups of MAP consumers: the first with 231 respondents who use these products for phytotherapeutic purposes, the second group—with 297 respondents who use them as cosmetic and personal care products. The collected data were statistically analysed using the k-means clustering model, resulting in two distinct clusters in both consumer groups: cluster 1, the “Curious”, and Cluster 2, the “Knowledgeable”. For the consumers of the second cluster, consumption was positively correlated with healthcare and environmental protection, while they exhibited a growing interest in environmentally certified MAP products. The results obtained contribute to a better understanding of the MAP products consumption behaviour while tackling the practical implications for stakeholders in the pharmaceutical and cosmetics industry through the development and innovation of products tailored to consumer needs. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {In the era of the social web, microblogging is a popular social media that enables users to share their feelings, ideas, and comments about everyday-life events, trends, and advertisements. Great emphasis has been placed on the investigation of human behavior in social networks by analyzing user-generated content to capture feelings and emotions from natural language. Delving into human reactions to events from the social message streams allows understanding collective moods and preferences of web users and supporting market strategies as well as political consensus analysis. This paper proposes a novel approach to the emotion-based classification of microblogging messages such as Twitter. The classification method is unsupervised and exploits the well-known fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering algorithm, proposing an enhanced version called entropy weighted FCM (shortly, EwFCM) that overcomes the main drawback of the FCM, viz., the sensitivity to the random cluster initialization by leveraging a fuzzy measure to evaluate the entropy in the data distribution. The fuzzy entropy measure allows minimizing the fuzziness of clustering, speeding up the convergence of the clustering algorithm. The proposed approach aims at analyzing microblogging-based trends to detect the main emotions expressed in the textual content, according to a well-known computational analysis of emotions whose main models are attributable to Ekman and Plutchik. The experiments reveal that the presented approach offers high accuracy in the emotion-based classification of textual resources; comparisons with the FCM algorithm applied for emotion classification show that the proposed method converges faster and provides promising classification performance, as evaluated by common metrics such as accuracy, precision, and F1-score. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {The rapid development of cloud applications, data sharing, processing, and cloud users is more encouraged to rely on remote storage in cloud-based data centers, and the amount of data created by applications is growing at an alarming rate. On the other hand, customers found it challenging to adapt to data sharing and data processing applications. Outlier detection may be used in a broad range of areas, but it is a challenging job. This article analyzes using a clustering-based K-means method with three closest cluster counts (K − 1, K, and K + 1) and a radius calculation for each cluster, as well as the use of a clustering-based K-means algorithm with three closest cluster counts (K − 1, K, and K + 1). It is described to analyze density peak clustering technique, which will enhance the clustering of intrusion assaults. Anomaly intrusion detection system, created using the original density peak clustering method, was found to provide accurate findings that could be utilized by the intrusion detection system’s data mining module. We propose a novel improvement to the DPC algorithm by modifying the calculation of the local density method based on the cutoff distance parameter rather than the cosine similarity parameter to enhance picking the peak outlier points during the second objective. The second goal is to improve clustering of high-dimensional nonlinear dynamic indivisible network traffic data while simultaneously decreasing the amount of noise by using the Gaussian kernel measure as a distance metric instead of the Euclidean distance. As a result, this article proposes a contextual deep clustering technique based on an ensemble the merits of the density peak clustering technique and three closest cluster counts called DeepDCP-CC algorithm thorough investigation of Euclidian distance measurements to find the optimal number of clusters for enhanced intrusion detection performance. After doing the study, it was discovered that this work displays around 90% detection accuracy for the entire system and nearly 100% detection accuracy for selected clusters. As a result of this work, a novel algorithm to reduce the features of attack characteristics in order to justify the gaps in data processing frameworks is proposed, as is an algorithm to derive a strong rule engine from analyzing the attack characteristics in order to detect newer attacks with a significant reduction in processing time. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

	abstract = {Currently, spectral clustering has attracted wide attention in clustering analysis domain. Compared with traditional partition-based clustering algorithm, spectral clustering is more adaptable to data distribution and less computational complexity for the large-scale data sets. Nevertheless, a single spectral clustering algorithm is affected by initialization, which results in unstable clustering results, especially when the data type and structure are more complicated. This paper proposes a novel approach of selective ensemble method based on spectral clustering to solve this issue. First of all, We obtain multiple spectral clustering results by random initialization parameters and generate candidate base clustering members. The normalized mutual information (NMI) is used to select high quality base clusterings from these candidate members as the input of clustering ensemble. Secondly, a new method of distance decision is devised as a consistency to evaluate the base clusterings. Finally, we introduce the cumulative matrix obtained by distance decision into the density peaks clustering method to gain the results of clustering ensemble. We implement the proposed method in UCI machine learning database that is commonly used in the field of clustering analysis, and experimental results demonstrate that our method can effectively improve the accuracy of single clustering algorithm. © 2019 IEEE.},

In order to mine the hidden information and to capture better clustering results, a trajectory regression clustering method (an unsupervised trajectory clustering method) is proposed to reduce local information loss of the trajectory and to avoid getting stuck in the local optimum. Using this method, we first define our new concept of trajectory clustering and construct a novel partitioning (angle-based partitioning) method of line segments; second, the Lagrange-based method and Hausdorff-based K-means++ are integrated in fuzzy C-means (FCM) clustering, which are used to maintain the stability and the robustness of the clustering process; finally, least squares regression model is employed to achieve regression clustering of the trajectory. In our experiment, the performance and effectiveness of our method is validated against real-world taxi GPS data. When comparing our clustering algorithm with the partition-based clustering algorithms (K-means, K-median, and FCM), our experimental results demonstrate that the presented method is more effective and generates a more reasonable trajectory. © 2018 by the authors.

In the real-world, when a person is uncooperative with the systems such as in video surveillance then masking is further common scenarios. For these masks, current face recognition performance degrades. An abundant number of researches work has been performed for recognizing faces under different conditions like changing pose or illumination, degraded images, etc. Still, difficulties created by masks are usually disregarded. The primary concern to this work is about facial masks, and especially to enhance the recognition accuracy of different masked faces. A feasible approach has been proposed that consists of first detecting the facial regions. The occluded face detection problem has been approached using Multi-Task Cascaded Convolutional Neural Network (MTCNN). Then facial features extraction is performed using the Google FaceNet embedding model. And finally, the classification task has been performed by Support Vector Machine (SVM). Experiments signify that this mentioned approach gives a remarkable performance on masked face recognition. Besides, its performance has been also evaluated within excessive facial masks and found attractive outcomes. Finally, a correlative study also made here for a better understanding. © 2019 IEEE.},

Clustering is an unsupervised classification method with the major aim of partitioning, where objects in the same cluster are similar, and objects which belong to different clusters vary significantly, with respect to their attributes. However, the classical Standardized Euclidean distance, which uses standard deviation to down weight maximum points of the ith features on the distance clusters, has been criticized by many scholars that the method produces outliers, lack robustness, and has 0% breakdown points. It also has low efficiency in normal distribution. Therefore, to remedy the problem, we suggest two statistical estimators which have 50% breakdown points namely the Sn and Qn estimators, with 58% and 82% efficiency, respectively.

	abstract = {Because it is very expensive to collect a large number of labeled samples to train deep neural networks in certain fields, semi-supervised learning (SSL) researcher has become increasingly important in recent years. There are many consistency regularization-based methods for solving SSL tasks, such as the Π model and mean teacher. In this paper, we first show through an experiment that the traditional consistency-based methods exist the following two problems: (1) as the size of unlabeled samples increases, the accuracy of these methods increases very slowly, which means they cannot make full use of unlabeled samples. (2) When the number of labeled samples is vary small, the performance of these methods will be very low. Based on these two findings, we propose two methods, metric learning clustering (MLC) and auxiliary fake samples, to alleviate these problems. The proposed methods achieve state-of-the-art results on SSL benchmarks. The error rates are 10.20%, 38.44% and 4.24% for CIFAR-10 with 4000 labels, CIFAR-100 with 10,000 labels and SVHN with 1000 labels by using MLC.

Fortunately, not all users have completely different service preferences. Due to the same application scenarios and personal interests, some users have the same preferences for certain types of Web services. This paper explores the problem of user clustering in the service environment, grouping users according to their service preferences. It helps service providers to identify and characterize the preferences of similar users and provide them with customized services. We propose two combination-based clustering algorithms which make full use of the advantages of the K-means algorithm and the affinity propagation algorithm. In addition, a three-stage clustering process is elaborated to improve the accuracy of user clustering. To reduce the time complexity of the algorithms, we create a parallel execution model of the algorithms implemented by a higher-order MapReduce sequence linking technology. Extensive experiments on simulated datasets and real datasets are performed on the comparisons between the proposed algorithms and the other combination-based clustering algorithms.

	abstract = {Drawback of almost partition based clustering algorithms is the requirement for the number of clusters specified at the beginning. Identifying the true number of clusters at the beginning is a difficult problem. So far, there were some works studied on this issue but no method is perfect in every case. This paper proposes a method to find the appropriate number of clusters in the clustering process by making an index indicated the appropriate number of clusters. This index is built from the intra-cluster coefficient and inter-cluster coefficient. The intra-cluster coefficient reflects intra-distortion of the cluster. The inter-cluster coefficient reflects the distance among clusters. Those coefficients are made only by extremely marginal objects of clusters. The looking for the extremely marginal objects and the building of the index are integrated in a weighted FCM algorithm and it is calculated suitably while the weighted Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) is processing. The Extended weighted FCM algorithm integrated this index is called Fuzzy C-Means-Extended (FCM-E). Not only does the FCM-E seek the clusters, but it also finds the appropriate number of clusters. The authors experiment with the FCM-E on some data sets of University of California, Irvine (UCI): Iris, Wine, Breast Cancer Wisconsin, and Glass and compare the results of the proposed method with the results of the other methods. The results of proposed method obtained are encouraging. © 2018, Zarka Private University. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In data mining, data clustering is a prevalent data analysis methodology that organizes unlabeled data points into distinct clusters based on a similarity measure. In recent years, several clustering algorithms found, dependent on a predefined number of clusters and centered around the dataset with either numeric or categorical attributes only. However, many real-world engineer-ing, scientific, and industrial applications involve datasets with mixed numeric as well as categorical attributes but lack domain knowledge (target labels). Clustering unlabeled-mixed datasets is a challenging task as (1) it is difficult to estimate the number of clusters in the absence of domain knowledge and (2) mathematical operations cannot be applied directly to the mixed dataset. In this paper, an efficient searching and fast convergent automatic data clustering algorithm based on population-based meta-heuristic optimization is proposed to deal with the mixed dataset. The proposed clustering algorithm aims to find the optimal number of cluster partitions automatically. It utilizes a real-coded variable-length candidate solution to detect the optimal number of clusters automatically. The concepts of threshold setting and cut-off ratio are used in the optimization process to refine the clusters. The similarity between data points and different cluster centers is measured using Euclidean distance (for numeric attributes) and the probability of co-occurrence of values (for categorical attributes). The proposed algorithm is compared with existing mixed data clustering techniques based on a statistical significance test and two robustness measures: Average accuracy and Standard deviation. Finally, the proposed algorithm is validated by applying to a real historical postoperative surgical mixed data set obtained from a surgical department of a multispecialty hospital in India. Results show the effectiveness, robustness, and usefulness of the proposed clustering algorithm. © 2020 The Authors.},

	abstract = {This paper focuses on the unsupervised detection of the Higgs boson particle using the most informative features and variables which characterize the “Higgs machine learning challenge 2014” data set. This unsupervised detection goes in this paper analysis through 4 steps: (1) selection of the most informative features from the considered data; (2) definition of the number of clusters based on the elbow criterion. The experimental results showed that the optimal number of clusters that group the considered data in an unsupervised manner corresponds to 2 clusters; (3) proposition of a new approach for hybridization of both hard and fuzzy clustering tuned with Ant Lion Optimization (ALO); (4) comparison with some existing metaheuristic optimizations such as Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). By employing a multi-angle analysis based on the cluster validation indices, the confusion matrix, the efficiencies and purities rates, the average cost variation, the computational time and the Sammon mapping visualization, the results highlight the effectiveness of the improved Gustafson–Kessel algorithm optimized with ALO (ALOGK) to validate the proposed approach. Even if the paper gives a complete clustering analysis, its novel contribution concerns only the Steps (1) and (3) considered above. The first contribution lies in the method used for Step (1) to select the most informative features and variables. We used the t-Statistic technique to rank them. Afterwards, a feature mapping is applied using Self-Organizing Map (SOM) to identify the level of correlation between them. Then, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), a metaheuristic optimization technique, is used to reduce the data set dimension. The second contribution of this work concern the third step, where each one of the clustering algorithms as K-means (KM), Global K-means (GlobalKM), Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM), Fuzzy C-means (FCM), Gustafson–Kessel (GK) and Gath–Geva (GG) is optimized and tuned with ALO. © 2020 Tech Science Press.

	abstract = {Digital footprints collected from social media platforms are often clustered using methods such as the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) and its variants to identify daily travel activities (e.g., dwelling, working, entertainment, and eating). However, these clustering methods mostly only consider the spatial distribution of travel activity points while ignoring their geographic context, resulting in the aggregation of digital footprints representing different activity types into one cluster. In addition, existing works only focus on examining people's travel activities at either the collective (i.e., macro) or individual (i.e., micro) level. To this end, this study utilizes geographic context information and develops a novel activity knowledge discovery framework to better detect frequent travel activities at both levels. First, we develop a multi-level spatial clustering method to aggregate digital footprints of a group of users into collective clusters (i.e., activity zones) by inferring and integrating the underlying activities performed at each zone with OpenStreetMap (OSM) datasets that can inform geographic context of the activity zones. Next, we introduce a location-aware clustering method to detect activity zones and associate activity types at the individual level by aggregating individual footprints based on the collective results. As case studies, digital footprints from 49 selected Twitter users are analyzed to evaluate the proposed framework. The results reveal that: (1) The multi-level spatial clustering method can often detect significant collective activity zones; and (2) The location-aware clustering method can aggregate individual digital footprints into activity zones more effectively compared with existing density-based spatial clustering methods (e.g., DBSCAN). © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

A density peaking algorithm KT-DPC based on kd-tree optimization is proposed. The algorithm defines the local density p through K-nearest neighbor and uses kd-tree to accelerate the local density p and distance 8. In addition, in the confirmation stage of clustering center, a clustering center confirmation strategy (C2BD, clustering center confirmation based on difference) is proposed. The difference between adjacent y is calculated by arranging y=p∗S in ascending order, and the boundary between clustering center and non-clustering center is found according to the change of difference. This method automatically confirms the clustering center of the algorithm, avoiding the problems of strong subjectivity and insufficient clustering accuracy caused by manually confirming the clustering center.

Computational methods in drug discovery are considerably cheaper than conventional methods and offer opportunities of screening very large numbers of compounds in conditions that would be simply impossible within the wet lab experimental settings. We explored the use of global quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models and molecular ligand docking in the discovery of new c-src tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Using a dataset of 1038 compounds from ChEMBL database, we developed over 350 QSAR classification models. A total of 49 models with reasonably good performance were selected and the models were assembled by stacking with a simple majority vote and used for the virtual screening of over 100,000 compounds. A total of 744 compounds were predicted by at least 50% of the QSAR models as active, 147 compounds were within the applicability domain and predicted by at least 75% of the models to be active. The latter 147 compounds were submitted to molecular ligand docking using AutoDock Vina and LeDock, and 89 were predicted to be active based on the energy of binding. © 2019 by the authors.

	abstract = {The k-means algorithm is undoubtedly the most widely used data clustering algorithm due to its relative simplicity. It can only handle data that are linearly separable. A generalization of k-means is kernel k-means, which can handle data that are not linearly separable. Standard k-means and kernel k-means have the same disadvantage of being sensitive to the initial placement of the cluster centers. A novel kernel k-means algorithm is proposed in the paper. The proposed algorithm uses a graph based kernel matrix and finds k data points as initial centers for kernel k-means. Since finding the optimal data points as initial centers is an NP-hard problem, this problem is relaxed to obtain k representative data points as initial centers. Matching pursuit algorithm for multiple vectors is used to greedily find k representative data points. The proposed algorithm is tested on synthetic and real-world datasets and compared with kernel k-means algorithms using other initialization techniques. Our empirical study shows encouraging results of the proposed algorithm. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

Tsangaris and Naughton [TN91, TN92] have shown that the partition-based techniques are superior. However, their work is based on a single partitioning algorithm, the Kernighart and Lin heuristics, which is not applicable to realistically large object bases because of its high running-time complexity. The contribution of this paper is two-fold: (1) we devise a new class of greedy object graph partitioning algorithms (GGP) whose running-time complexity is moderate while still yielding good quality results. (2) Our extensive quantitative analysis of all well-known partitioning algorithms indicates that no one algorithm performs superior for all object net characteristics. Therefore, we propose an adaptable clustering strategy according to a multi-dimensional grid: the dimensions correspond to particular characteristics of the object base-given by, e.g., number and size of objects, degree of object sharing-and the grid entries indicate the most suitable clustering algorithm for the particular configuration. © 1993, Springer Verlag.

Its two major disadvantages lie in the facts that the algorithm is sensitive to initial cluster centers and the outliers exert significant influence on the clustering results. In addition, K-Means algorithm traverses and computes all the data multiple times. Thus, the algorithm is not efficient when dealing with large data sets. In order to overcome the above limitations, this paper proposes to exclude the outliers using the minimum number of points in the d-dimensional hypersphere area. Then k cluster centers can be obtained by adjusting the threshold making use of density idea. Finally, K-Means algorithm will be integrated with Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA). The time efficiency is improved considerably through taking advantage of computing power of Graphic Processing Unit (GPU). We use the ratio of distance between classes to distance within classes and speedup as the evaluation criteria. The experiments indicate that the proposed algorithm significantly improves the stability and running efficiency of K-Means algorithm. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

The proposed algorithm first employ conventional Gaussian kernel density estimation method to find the highly density data areas in one dimension. Then the projection step is to iteratively use density estimation from the lower variance dimensions to the higher variance ones until all the dimensions are computed. Experiments on actual datasets show that our method can get similar results compared with other conventional methods with fewer computation tasks. © 2016 IEEE.},

Sensors which continuously generate data are one important source of Big Data and have innumerous applications in real life scenario. As storing the entire data becomes expensive, summarization is the need of the hour. Data Summarization is a compact representation of the entire data which can reduce storage and processing requirements. In this work, we try to effectively summarize Sensor Data using simple but effective techniques such as sampling and clustering and analyze the performance of the summarized data in comparison to the complete dataset. Popular classification techniques like KNN, SVM and Naive Bayes are used to evaluate the efficiency of the summarization techniques by training the classifiers using the summarized data and testing with the test data set. The performance of the summarized dataset and the complete dataset are compared. The experimental results show that summarized data set performs almost equally well as the complete data set. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.},

Human activities could be detected based on sensory data that are available on today's smart phone. In this study, we consider mobile phones as an independent device since sending the data to central server can generate privacy issues. Furthermore, applying AR on mobile phone does not only require an effective accuracy rate but also the lowest power consumption. Normally, an AR model learnt from acceleration data of a specific person is distributed to other people to recognize the same activities instead of generating different models individually. This work often cannot create accurate results on the prediction in broad range of participants. Moreover, such AR model also has to allow each user to update his new activities independently. Therefore, we propose an algorithm that integrates Support Vector Machine classifier and K -medoids clustering method to resolve completely the demand. © 2013 Quang Viet Vo et al.},

This algorithm improves the heavy-edge matching (HEM) algorithm, adds a new constraint for coarsening, conducts segmentation using the algorithm similar to KL, and finally achieves the re-design and assessment for graph partitioning algorithm in combination with annealing algorithm. Compared with traditional graph partitioning, the proposed algorithm takes into account the heterogeneity of the infrastructure, and so it is not limited to the balance partitioning. The simulation results of test show that compared with the traditional KL graph partitioning algorithm, the proposed hybrid algorithm can achieve a good balance between execution time and solution quality, and so its overall performance is better than that of the traditional algorithms. © 2016, Central South University of Technology.

	abstract = {In current years, data streams have been gradually turn into most important research area in the field of computer science. Data streams are defined as fast, limitless, unbounded, river flow, continuous, stop less, massive, tremendous unremitting, immediate, stream flow, arrival of ordered and unordered data. Data streams are divided into two types, they are online and offline streams. Online data streams are mainly used for real world applications like face book, twitter, network traffic monitoring, intrusion detection and credit card processes. Offline data streams are mainly used for manipulating the information which is based on web log streams. In data streams, data size is extremely huge and potentially infinite and it is not possible to lay up all the data, so it leads to a mining challenge where shortage of limitations has occur in hardware and software. Data mining techniques such as clustering, load shedding, classification and frequent pattern mining are to be applied in data streams to get useful knowledge. But, the existing algorithms are not suitable for performing the data mining process in data streams; hence there is a need for new techniques and algorithms. The main objective of this research work is to perform the clustering process in data streams and detecting the outliers in data streams. New hybrid approach is proposed which combines the hierarchical clustering algorithm and partitioning clustering algorithm. In hierarchical clustering, CURE algorithm is used and enhanced (E-CURE) and in partitioning clustering, CLARANS algorithm is used and enhanced (E-CLARANS). In this research work, the two algorithms E-CURE and E-CLARANS are combined (Hybrid) for performing a clustering process and finding the outliers in data streams. The performance of this hybrid clustering algorithm is compared with the existing hybrid clustering algorithms namely BIRCH with CLARANS and CURE with CLARANS. The performance factors used in this analysis are clustering accuracy and outlier detection accuracy. By analyzing the experimental results, it is observed that the proposed hybrid clustering approach E-CURE with E-CLARANS performance is more accurate than the existing hybrid clustering algorithms. © 2016 SERSC.},

	abstract = {A geotagged photo refers to that a photo contains its location information where it was taken. Compared with other existing applications, we show the photo clusters instead of all photos where the number of photo clusters is much less than that of all photos. We designed a clustering algorithm that clusters geotagged photos (abbreviated as GPCA) in accordance to thresholds of different scales. In general, GPCA is an alternative of k-means clustering algorithm. Given a scale graduation of a map, the distance threshold is also determined. Before clustering geotagged photos, we use the distance threshold to decide the number of clusters. In other words, the number of centriods is chosen according to the graduation scale of a map. GPCA clusters geotagged photos into different photo clusters. Then, GPCA recomputed the new centeriods of photo clusters. GPCA executes the computation of new centeriods iteratively until all centeriods are fixed. Note that prior partition-based clustering algorithms choose an arbitrary number of initial centriods at random. Also, choosing the number of centriods is considered as an application-dependent issue. As a result, they did not guarantee that the clustering quality is not the same every time. By taking advantage of the result of using photo clusters, the performance of map-enabled photo service is improved efficiently. © 2009 IEEE.},

In this paper, a partition-based clustering algorithm under the framework of membrane computing is proposed. The clustering algorithm is based on a tissue-like P system, which is used to exploit the optimal cluster centers for a data set. Each object in the tissue-like P system represents a group of candidate cluster centers and is evolved through simulated annealing mechanism and mutation mechanism. Meanwhile, communication rules are used to exchange and share the objects between different elementary membranes and between elementary membranes and the environment. The proposed clustering algorithm is evaluated over two artificial data sets and two real-life data sets and is further compared with k-means algorithm and GA-based k-means algorithm respectively. The comparison results reveal the superiority of the proposed clustering algorithm in terms of clustering quality and stability. © 2014 ISSN 1349-4198.},

	abstract = {Over the last decade a variety of clustering algorithms have evolved. However one of the simplest (and possibly overused) partition based clustering algorithm is K-means. It can be shown that the computational complexity of K-means does not suffer from exponential growth with dimensionality rather it is linearly proportional with the number of observations and number of clusters. The crucial requirements are the knowledge of cluster number and the computation of some suitably chosen similarity measure. For this simplicity and scalability, among large data sets K-means remains an attractive alternative when compared to other competing clustering philosophies especially for high dimensional domain. However being a deterministic algorithm, traditional K-means have several drawbacks. It only offers hard decision rule, with no probabilistic interpretation. In this paper we have developed a decision theoretic framework by which traditional K-means can be given a probabilistic footstep. This will not only enable us to do a soft clustering, rather the whole optimization problem could be recasted into Bayesian modeling framework, in which the knowledge of cluster number could be treated as an unknown parameter of interest, thus removing a severe constrain of K-means algorithm. Our basic idea is to keep the simplicity and scalability of K-means, while achieving some of the desired properties of the other model based or soft clustering approaches. © 2009 by World Scientific Publishing Co.

However, most of the gene expression data analysis algorithms, such as clustering, classification and network design, require a complete matrix of gene array during analysis. It is therefore very important to accurately impute the missing values before applying the data analysis algorithms. In this paper, a modified Local Least Square imputation based algorithm known as NSLLSimpute has been introduced which overcomes the drawbacks of previously developed LLSimpute and SLLSimpute algorithms. The performance of NSLLSimpute algorithm is compared with the most commonly used imputation methods like K-nearest neighbor imputation (KNNimpute), Sequential K-nearest neighbor imputation (SKNNimpute), Iterative K-nearest neighbor imputation (IKNNimpute), Singular Value Decomposition (SVDimpute), Local Least Squares imputation (LLSimpute) and Sequential Local Least Squares imputation (SLLSimpute) in terms estimation accuracy using Root Mean Square error when applied on four publicly available microarray data sets over different rates of randomly introduced missing entries. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This paper proposed an evolutionary clustering algorithm which can automatically determine the number of clusters present in a data set. The chromosomes are represented as strings of real numbers, encode the centers of a fixed number of clusters. The searching capability of evolutionary clustering is exploited in order to search for appropriate cluster centers in the feature space such that a similarity metric of the resulting clusters is optimized. The proposed clustering approach called Fast Automatic Clustering Evolution (FACE) in data set. To obtain a speedup over linear search in high dimensional data a randomized k-d trees based nearest neighbor search is used. The chromosomes are able to exchange their gene values according to nearest cluster centers and relation among genes in crossover operator. Mutation operator replaced the mutation gene value with respect to nearest neighbor cluster. Adaptive probabilities of crossover and mutation are employed to prevent the convergence of the GA (Genetic Algorithm) to a local optimum. The Adjusted-Rand Index is used as a measure of the validity of the clusters. Effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated for both artificial and real-life data sets. The experimental result demonstrates that the proposed clustering algorithm (FACE) has high performance, effectiveness and flexibility. The proposed evolutionary algorithm is able for clustering low to high dimensional data set. © 2012 Asian Network for Scientific Information.},

For both the algorithms, a set of n data points are given in a two-dimensional space and an integer K (the number of clusters) and the problem is to determine a set of n points in the given space called centers, so as to minimize the mean squared distance from each data point to its nearest center. The performance of the algorithms is investigated during different execution of the program for the given input data points. Based on experimental results the algorithms are compared regarding their clustering quality and their performance, which depends on the time complexity between the various numbers of clusters chosen by the end user.

	abstract = {Finding clusters in a high dimensional data space is challenging because a high dimensional data space has hundreds of attributes and hundreds of data tuples and the average density of data points is very low. The distance functions used by many conventional algorithms fail in this scenario. Clustering relies on computing the distance between objects and thus, the complexity of the similarity models has a severe influence on the efficiency of the clustering algorithms. Especially for density-based clustering, range queries must be supported efficiently to reduce the runtime of clustering. The density-based clustering is also influenced by the density divergence problem that affects the accuracy of clustering. If clusters do not exist in the original high dimensional data space, it may be possible that clusters exist in some subspaces of the original data space. Subspace clustering algorithms localize the search for relevant dimensions allowing them to find clusters that exist in multiple, possibly overlapping subspaces. Subspace clustering algorithms identifies such subspace clusters. But for clustering based on relative region densities in the subspaces, density based subspace clustering algorithms are applied where the clusters are regarded as regions whose densities are relatively high as compared to the region densities in a subspace. This study presents a review of various subspaces based clustering algorithms and density based clustering algorithms with their efficiencies on different data sets. © 2011 Asian Network for Scientific Information.},

However, a multitude of practical applications only supply approximate measurements. Usually, the estimated errors of the measurements are also available and they are valuable supplemental information for the classification process. Therefore, the development of highly efficient algorithms dealing with uncertain examples has emerged as an exciting new direction in stream data mining literature. In this study, an ensemble classification model ECluds is built from data streams having uncertain attribute values. ECluds applies supervised k-means clustering algorithm on uncertain data stream chunks, then extracts sufficient statistics into micro-clusters. An ensemble of micro-clusters performs classification on test examples using nearest neighbor algorithm and majority voting strategy. Our experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that ECluds is highly scalable for data streams and more effective than a purely deterministic method. © 2011 Asain Network for Scientific Information.},

Deciding upon the optimum placement for the base stations to achieve best services while reducing the cost is a complex task requiring vast computational resource. Approach: This study addresses antenna placement problem or the cell planning problem, involves locating and configuring infrastructure for mobile networks by modified the original density-based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise algorithm. The Cluster Partitioning around Medoids original algorithm has been modified and a new algorithm has been proposed by the authors in a recent work. In this study, the density-based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise original algorithm has been modified and combined with old algorithm to produce the hybrid algorithm Clustering Density Base and Clustering with Weighted Node-Partitioning around Medoids algorithm to solve the problems in Mobile Network Planning. Results: Implementation of this algorithm to a real case study is presented. Results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has minimum run time minimum cost and high grade of service. Conclusion: The proposed hyper algorithm has the advantage of quick divide the area into clusters where the density base algorithm has a limit iteration and the advantage of accuracy (no sampling method is used) and highly grade of service due to the moving of the location of the base stations (medoid) toward the heavy loaded (weighted) nodes. © 2011 Science Publications.},

Clusters that contain collateral, identical characteristics in a dataset are grouped using reiterative techniques. As the data in real world is growing day by day so very large datasets with little or no background knowledge can be identified into interesting patterns with clustering. So, in this paper the two most popular clustering algorithms K-Means and K-Medoids are evaluated on dataset transaction10k of KEEL. The input to these algorithms are randomly distributed data points and based on their similarity clusters has been generated. The comparison results show that time taken in cluster head selection and space complexity of overlapping of cluster is much better in K-Medoids than K-Means. Also K-Medoids is better in terms of execution time, non sensitive to outliers and reduces noise as compared to K-Means as it minimizes the sum of dissimilarities of data objects. © 2016 The Authors.},

We apply an early termination method based on the statistics of the resulted IPMs from both rough mode decision and most probable mode stages. The resulted IPMs are clustered into a K cluster by means of the K-medoid clustering algorithm, and each IPM cluster center represents all the IPMs within a cluster for the RDO process.

	abstract = {Finding clusters of arbitrary shapes in data streams is a challenging work for advanced applications. An effective approach to clustering arbitrary shapes is the clustering algorithm based on space partition. However, it cannot be applied directly into data stream clustering since it costs large memory spaces while data stream processing has strict memory space limitation. In addition, it has low efficiency for high dimensional data and fine granularity. Moreover, its fixed granularity partition isn't suitable for the changes on data distribution of data streams. Therefore, we propose a novel index structure CDS-Tree and design an improved space partition based clustering algorithm, which aims to cluster arbitrary shapes on high dimension streams data with high accuracy. CDS-Tree stores only non-empty cells and keeps the position relationship among cells, so its compact structure costs small memory spaces and gets high efficiency. Moreover, we propose a novel measure for data skew - DSF (Data Skew Factor) to be used to adjust automatically the partition granularity according to the change of data streams, thus the algorithm can gain high analysis accuracy within limited memory. The experimental results on real datasets and synthetic datasets show that this algorithm has higher clustering accuracy, and better scalability with the size of windows and data dimensionality than other typical algorithms applied in trivial style. © 2005 IEEE.},

First, the multi-Modes representation means of category centres of categorical data in K-prototypes algorithm is given, and then the Euclidean is expanded to mixed data so as to reflect the dissimilarity between the objects and categories more accurately in same framework. On the basis, a partitioned clustering algorithm for processing mixed data is proposed. Finally, the experimental results on UCI dataset show that the proposed algorithm can effectively improve the clustering performance comparing with the K-prototypes algorithm.},

	abstract = {Fast and high quality document clustering is a crucial task in organizing information, search engine results, enhancing web crawling, and information retrieval or filtering. Recent studies have shown that the most commonly used partition-based clustering algorithm, the K-means algorithm, is more suitable for large datasets. However, the K-means algorithm can generate a local optimal solution. In this paper we propose a novel Harmony K-means Algorithm (HKA) that deals with document clustering based on Harmony Search (HS) optimization method. It is proved by means of finite Markov chain theory that the HKA converges to the global optimum. To demonstrate the effectiveness and speed of HKA, we have applied HKA algorithms on some standard datasets. We also compare the HKA with other meta-heuristic and model-based document clustering approaches. Experimental results reveal that the HKA algorithm converges to the best known optimum faster than other methods and the quality of clusters are comparable. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

	abstract = {Functional inference of hypothetical proteins (HPs) is a significant task in the post-genomic era. We described here a network-based protocol for functional inference of HPs using experimental transcriptomic, proteomic, and protein-protein interaction (PPI) datasets. The protocol includes two steps: i) co-expression networks were constructed using large proteomic or transcriptomic datasets of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 under various stress conditions, and then combined with a Synechocystis PPI network to generate bi-colored networks that include both annotated proteins and HPs; ii) a global algorithm was adapted to the bi-colored networks for functional inference of HPs. The algorithm ranked the associations between genes/proteins with known GO functional categories, and assumed that the top one ranked HP for each GO functional category might have a function related to the GO functional category. We applied the protocol to all HPs of the model cyanobacterium Synechocystis, and were able to assign putative functions to 122 HPs that have never been functionally characterized previously. Finally, the functional inference was validated by the known biological information of operon, and results showed that more than 70% HPs could be correctly validated. The study provided a new protocol to integrate different types of OMICS datasets for functional inference of HPs, and could be useful in achieving new insights into the Synechocystis metabolism. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

Among various partition algorithms, fuzzy algorithms, Fuzzy c-Means (FCM), Gustafson–Kessel (GK) and non-fuzzy algorithm, k-means (KM) are most popular methods. k-means and Fuzzy c-Means use standard Euclidian distance measure and Gustafson–Kessel uses fuzzy covariance matrix in their distance metrics. In this work, a comparative study of these algorithms with different famous real world data sets, liver disorder and wine from the UCI repository is presented. The performance of the three algorithms is analyzed based on the clustering output criteria. The results were compared with the results obtained from the repository. The results showed that Gustafson–Kessel produces close results to Fuzzy c-Means. Further, the experimental results demonstrate that k-means outperforms the Fuzzy c-Means and Gustafson–Kessel algorithms. Thus the efficiency of k-means is better than that of Fuzzy c-Means and Gustafson–Kessel algorithms. © 2015},

	abstract = {Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) studies of cellular or subgrain microstructures present problems beyond those in the study of coarse-grained polycrystalline aggregates. In particular, identification of boundaries delineating some subgrain structures, such as microbands, cannot be accomplished simply with pixel-to-pixel misorientation thresholding because many of the boundaries are gradual transitions in crystallographic orientation. Fast multiscale clustering (FMC) is an established data segmentation technique that is combined here with quaternion representation of orientation to segment EBSD data with gradual transitions. This implementation of FMC addresses a common problem with segmentation algorithms, handling data sets with both high and low magnitude boundaries, by using a novel distance function that is a modification of Mahalanobis distance. It accommodates data representations, such as quaternions, whose features are not necessarily linearly correlated but have known distance functions. To maintain the linear run time of FMC with such data, the method requires a novel variance update rule. Although FMC was originally an algorithm for two-dimensional data segmentation, it can be generalized to analyze three-dimensional data sets. As examples, several segmentations of quaternion EBSD data sets are presented. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Presently, educational institutions compile and store huge volumes of data, such as student enrolment and attendance records, as well as their examination results. Mining such data yields stimulating information that serves its handlers well. Rapid growth in educational data points to the fact that distilling massive amounts of data requires a more sophisticated set of algorithms. This issue led to the emergence of the field of educational data mining (EDM). Traditional data mining algorithms cannot be directly applied to educational problems, as they may have a specific objective and function. This implies that a preprocessing algorithm has to be enforced first and only then some specific data mining methods can be applied to the problems. One such preprocessing algorithm in EDM is clustering. Many studies on EDM have focused on the application of various data mining algorithms to educational attributes. Therefore, this paper provides over three decades long (1983-2016) systematic literature review on clustering algorithm and its applicability and usability in the context of EDM. Future insights are outlined based on the literature reviewed, and avenues for further research are identified. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Clustering is one of the most important research areas in the field of data mining. Clustering means creating groups of objects based on their features in such a way that the objects belonging to the same groups are similar and those belonging in different groups are dissimilar. Clustering is an unsupervised learning technique. Data clustering is the subject of active research in several fields such as statistics, pattern recognition and machine learning. From a practical perspective clustering plays an outstanding role in data mining applications in many domains. The main advantage of clustering is that interesting patterns and structures can be found directly from very large data sets with little or none of the background knowledge. Clustering algorithms can be applied in many areas, for instance marketing, biology, libraries, insurance, city-planning, earthquake studies and www document classification. Data mining adds to clustering the complications of very large datasets with very many attributes of different types. This imposes unique computational requirements on relevant clustering algorithms. A variety of algorithms have recently emerged that meet these requirements and were successfully applied to real-life data mining problems. They are subject of this survey. Also, this survey explores the behavior of some of the partition based clustering algorithms and their basic approaches with experimental results. © 2011 Asian Network for Scientific Information.},

	abstract = {Clustering is an unsupervised classification method and plays essential role in applications in diverse fields. The evolutionary methods attracted attention and gained popularity among the data mining researchers for clustering due to their expedient implementation, parallel nature, ability to search global optima, and other advantages over conventional methods. However, conventional clustering methods, e.g., K-means, are computationally efficient and widely used local search methods. Therefore, many researchers paid attention to hybrid algorithms. However, most of the algorithms lag in proper balancing of exploration and exploitation of solutions in the search space. In this work, the authors propose a hybrid method DKGK. It uses DE to diversify candidate solutions in the search space. The obtained solutions are refined by K-means. Further, GA with heuristic crossover operator is applied for fast convergence of solutions and the obtained solutions are further refined by K-means. This is why proposed method is called DKGK. Performance of the proposed method is compared to that of Deferential Evolution (DE), genetic algorithm (GA), a hybrid of DE and K-means (DEKM), and a hybrid of GA and K-Means (GAKM) based on the sum of intra-cluster distances. The results obtained on three real and two synthetic datasets are very encouraging as the proposed method DKGK outperforms all the competing methods. © Springer India 2014.},

	abstract = {In this paper, an improved electrocardiogram (ECG) beats classification system is proposed, which is based on Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering algorithm. The classification of ECG beats is necessary in order to diagnose the type of arrhythmia (e.g., Atrial Premature Contraction (APC), Premature Ventricular Contraction (PVC), Right Bundle Branch Block (RBBB) etc.) present in the ECG records. The efficiency of any classification model highly depends on the “most relevant” set of features used. The primary goal of this study is to classify different arrhythmic beats with reduced set of relevant-only ECG attributes. The attribute selection model is based on Mahalanobis-Taguchi System (MTS); a multi-dimensional pattern recognition tool, which can dynamically choose the important set of ECG features. The number of most relevant features can vary from person to person according to the type of arrhythmia present in the respective ECG signals. A traditional Euclidian Distance (ED) based FCM can detect the spherical clusters but it may lead to improper clustering in some cases. As a solution to this problem, Mahalanobis Distance (MD) is used in the proposed model in order to improve the distance measurement procedure. In our proposed system, MD based improved Fuzzy C-Means (FCM-M) clustering is used to classify the arrhythmic beats. Experimental results show that the performance of FCM-M is significantly better than the conventional FCM for arrhythmia classification. Another direction of our proposed research is to use the concept of initial cluster centroid in order to reduce the number of program iterations. In our experiments, the number of program iterations is reduced to an average of 53% when initial centroid is assigned to FCM-M with the same classification results. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

However, with the increasing development of cloud computing and big data, large scale dataset has been a big challenge for clustering. For example, the execution of clustering algorithm is too time-consuming, the optimization of parameters is difficult, and the quality of clusters is not good. To this end, in this paper, we proposed a common framework of partition-based clustering algorithms such as k-means, and designed its MapReduce implementation. Specifically, in order to deal with the representation of large scale dataset, we propose to employ sampling technique. Then, inspired by k-means algorithm, we propose a common procedure of clustering, and provide a k-means based implementation. Furthermore, we implement proposed framework using MapReduce programming model. Experiments show that our method is efficient for large scale dataset. © 2016, Strojarski Facultet.

Clusters that contain collateral, identical characteristics in a dataset are grouped using reiterative techniques. As the data in real world is growing day by day so very large datasets with little or no background knowledge can be identified into interesting patterns with clustering. So, in this paper the two most popular clustering algorithms K-Means and K-Medoids are evaluated on dataset transaction10k of KEEL. The input to these algorithms are randomly distributed data points and based on their similarity clusters has been generated. The comparison results show that time taken in cluster head selection and space complexity of overlapping of cluster is much better in K-Medoids than K-Means. Also K-Medoids is better in terms of execution time, non sensitive to outliers and reduces noise as compared to K-Means as it minimizes the sum of dissimilarities of data objects. © 2016 The Authors.},

Therefore, clustering techniques are proposed for reducing the size of data to keep the performance of the entire system by selecting groups of data that is depend on their similarity. According to this k-means and hierarchical clustering techniques have been designed. The well-known techniques are clustering large application-based upon randomized search and clustering and balanced iterative reducing and clustering using hierarchy. However, one of the remained problems is size of data still large. This can make the whole processes of data mining works slowly. Another is that the similarity value of the clusters is still not high enough for to be used, particularly, in the process of decision making. Therefore, this paper presents a model of clustering to provide higher efficiency of the process of k-mean and hierarchical clustering. The efficiency of the proposed model is better than traditional techniques by 0.5-1.3 % approximately in term of giving higher similarity value. Besides, the running time of the model is also faster than the comparative studies about 2.7-7.4 times. © 2015 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The speed range of Levels of Service (LOS) categories is not well defined for highly heterogeneous traffic flow on urban streets in Indian context. Determination of speed ranges of LOS categories of urban traffic facilities helps in planning, design of transportation projects and also allocation of resources among competing projects. In this study an attempt has been made to define LOS criteria for urban street in Indian context considering the free flow speed (FFS), congested travel speed, the geometric and surrounding environmental conditions. Defining LOS criteria is basically a classification problem and cluster analysis is found to be the most suitable technique that can be applied. In this study Clustering Large Applications (CLARA) method is used. Large numbers of speed data are used as an input to CLARA. Using Global Positioning System (GPS) large numbers of second by second speed data are collected and GIS was used in handling large amount of speed data. The clustering algorithm is used twice in this study. The optimal number of clusters is determined using six cluster validation parameters which help in deciding the classification of street segments into numbers of classes. CLARA algorithm was used to classify the FFS data into a number of classes to get the FFS ranges of different urban street classes such that street segments following a class must satisfy its functional and geometric characteristics. In the second stage CLARA algorithm is used on average travel speed data collected during both peak and off-peak hours to determine the speed ranges of different LOS categories. From the above study the FFS ranges for different urban street classes and speed ranges for different LOS categories are defined and the values are found to be lower than that suggested by HCM-2000. Average travel speed of LOS categories expressed in terms of percentage of FFS of the street classes are found to be 85 and above, 70-85, 55-70, 40-55, 30-40, 30 and below respectively for LOS "A" to "F". This result closely follows the percentage shown in HCM-2010.},

	abstract = {The RFM (recency, frequency and monetary) model has been widely applied for personal customers' analysis, but limited for the institutional customers. Therefore, the study takes a digital content provider with institutional customers of a variety of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in Taipei city for RFM clustering and deploys an innovative method combining RFM model and fuzzy c-means (FCM) for analysis. Clustering results suggest that September and October are the two busiest months of transactions for major customers. Moreover, major customers have twice of transactions and total transaction amount of 6,462 USD; i.e., an average transaction amount of 3,231 USD. Consequently, for a digital content provider, the enough staff and equipment preparations must ready before September and October to make sure a high quality service for major customers. The average transaction amount implies that the approximate cost of 3,250 USD is the upper bound of willing to pay for many SMEs. Therefore, to deliver the customized service packages with the charges close to 3,250 USD are the first priority of services development for a digital content provider. © 2012 Asian Network for Scientific Information.},

	abstract = {K-Means is a widely used partition based clustering algorithm famous for its simplicity and speed. It organizes input dataset into predefined number of clusters. K-Means has a major limitation -- the number of clusters, K, need to be pre-specified as an input. Prespecifying K in the K-Means algorithm sometimes becomes difficult in absence of thorough domain knowledge, or for a new and unknown dataset. This limitation of advance specification of cluster number can lead to “forced” clustering of data and proper classification does not emerge. In this paper, a new algorithm based on the K-Means is developed. This algorithm has advance features of intelligent data analysis and automatic generation of appropriate number of clusters. The clusters generated by the new algorithm are compared against results obtained with the original K-Means and various other famous clustering algorithms. This comparative analysis is done using sets of real data. © 2016 SERSC.},

	abstract = {Data clustering is a hotspot in data mining area. Though there have been lots of data clustering algorithms now, the clustering accuracy of them is far from perfect. A structural similarity based network clustering algorithm (SSNCA) is proposed in this paper, which attempt to further improve the data clustering accuracy from the view of network clustering. The concrete solution scheme is that vector dataset for clustering is converted to a k-Nearest-Neigborhood network and SSNCA is used to cluster this network. Comparing SSNCA with the algorithms of c-Means and affinity propagation (AP), experimental result shows that the fitness value got by the proposed algorithm is a little worse than AP, but its clustering accuracy is obviously better than that of the other two algorithms.},
