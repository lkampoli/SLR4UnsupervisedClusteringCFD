Abstract = {Clustering is one of the significant tasks in data mining, and
   partition-based clustering algorithms such as k-means are one of the
   popular solutions. However, with the increasing development of cloud
   computing and big data, large scale dataset has been a big challenge for
   clustering. For example, the execution of clustering algorithm is too
   time-consuming, the optimization of parameters is difficult, and the
   quality of clusters is not good. To this end, in this paper, we proposed
   a common framework of partition-based clustering algorithms such as
   k-means, and designed its MapReduce implementation. Specifically, in
   order to deal with the representation of large scale dataset, we propose
   to employ sampling technique. Then, inspired by k-means algorithm, we
   propose a common procedure of clustering, and provide a k-means based
   implementation. Furthermore, we implement proposed framework using
   MapReduce programming model. Experiments show that our method is
   efficient for large scale dataset.},

Abstract = {Three-dimensional Field Programmable Gate Arrays (3D FPGAs) represent a
   viable alternative to overcome challenges of integration complexity in
   modern embedded systems. Mapping applications into 3D FPGAs requires a
   set of accompanying suite of Computer-Aided Design (CAD) tools. One of
   critical issue of a 3D FPGA-based implementation is the quality and
   efficiency of associated CAD algorithms. In this paper, we are
   interested to investigate placement algorithms aspect to optimize
   proposed 3D FPGA performances. In fact, the way we distribute clusters
   between 3D FPGA layers has an important impact on performances. We
   present partitioning-based placement algorithm for 3D FPGA. The circuit
   is first divided into two layers with limited number of inter-layer
   interconnections, and then placed on individual layers. Placement
   solution of each layer is then gradually improved using adapted
   simulated annealing algorithm. We conduct experiments using exploration
   platform to compare partitioning-based and simulated annealing based
   placement approaches for proposed 3D FPGA architecture. Exploration
   results show that using partitioning-based placement algorithm achieves
   a saving in terms of power consumption, area and performance by an
   average of 15\%, 18\% and 10\% Unlike DFPGA, MS-FPGA can deal with
   complex circuits.},

Abstract = {Data mining is one of the interesting research areas in database
   technology. In data mining, a cluster is a set of data objects that are
   similar to one another with in a cluster and are different to the
   entities in the former clusters. Clustering is the efficient method in
   data mining in order to process huge data sets. The core methodology of
   clustering is used in many domains like academic result analysis of
   institutions. Also, the methods are very well suited in machine
   learning, clustering in medical dataset, pattern recognition, image
   mining, information retrieval and bioinformatics. The clustering
   algorithms are categorized based upon different research phenomenon.
   Varieties of algorithms have recently occurred and were effectively
   applied to real-life data mining problems. This survey mainly focuses on
   partition based clustering algorithms namely k-Means, k-Medoids and
   Fuzzy c-Means In particular, they applied mostly in medical data sets.
   The importance of the survey is to explore the various applications in

Abstract = {Cluster analysis is one of the basic tools for discovering structure in
   data sets. Soft clustering enables the user to have a good overall view
   of the information contained in the data set that he has. However,
   existing soft algorithms suffer from various aspects. We propose GPSC
   (Graph Partition-based Soft clustering), an efficient soft clustering
   algorithm based on a given graph model. This algorithm projected data
   set to a graph firstly, applied graph partition method to get an initial
   clustering result. Secondly, the core vertices and verge vertices have
   been defined to measure the membership for each vertex to clusters and
   relationships of neighbor clusters. Then the membership matrix and
   relationship matrix have been induced From these two matrixes, we can
   find more fuzzy relations and latent clusters. Our experiments show that
   GPSC algorithm is able to discover clusters that cannot be detected by
   non-fuzzy algorithms, while maintaining a high degree of efficiency.
   Comparison with existing hard clustering algorithms like K-means and its
   variants shows that GPSC is both effective and efficient.},

Abstract = {A re-ranking technique, called ``PageRank{''}, brings a Successful story
   behind the Google (TM) search engine. Many studies focus on finding an
   efficient way to compute the PageRank scores of a large web graph.
   Researchers propose to compute them sequentially by reducing the I/O
   cost of disk access, improving the convergence rate, or even employing
   Peer-2-Peer architecture, etc. However, only a few concentrate on
   computation using parallel processing techniques. In this paper, we
   propose a Partition-based parallel PageRank algorithm that can
   efficiently be run on a low-cost parallel environment like PC cluster.
   For comparison, we also study other two well-known PageRank techniques,
   and provide an analytical discussion of their performance in terms of
   I/O and synchronization cost, as well as memory usage. Experimental
   results show a promising improvement on a large artificial web graph
   synthesized from the TH domain.},

Abstract = {A novel random sample partition-based clustering ensemble (RSP-CE)
   algorithm is proposed in this paper to handle the big data clustering
   problems. There are three key components in RSP-CE algorithm, i.e.,
   generating the base clustering results on RSP data blocks, harmonizing
   the based clustering results with maximum mean discrepancy (MMD)
   criterion, and refining the RSP clustering results. RSP data blocks have
   the consistent sample distributions with the whole big data and thus
   provide the possibility for using base clustering results on different
   data subsets to approximate the clustering result on whole big data. The
   experimental results in comparison with other 5 well-known clustering
   ensemble algorithms on 4 big data sets show that RSP-CE algorithm
   obtains the better normalized mutual information (NMI) values and
   Fowlkes-Mallows Index (FMI) values with the less training time
   consumptions and thus demonstrate that RSP-CE algorithm is a viable
   approach to deal with the big data clustering problems.},

Abstract = {Partition-based methods are increasingly-used in extreme multi-label
   classification (XMC) problems due to their scalability to large output
   spaces (e.g., millions or more). However, existing methods partition the
   large label space into mutually exclusive clusters, which is sub-optimal
   when labels have multi-modality and rich semantics. For instance, the
   label ``Apple{''} can be the fruit or the brand name, which leads to the
   following research question: can we disentangle these multi-modal labels
   with non-exclusive clustering tailored for downstream XMC tasks? In this
   paper, we show that the label assignment problem in partition-based XMC
   can be formulated as an optimization problem, with the objective of
   maximizing precision rates. This leads to an efficient algorithm to form
   flexible and overlapped label clusters, and a method that can
   alternatively optimizes the cluster assignments and the model parameters
   for partition-based XMC. Experimental results on synthetic and real
   datasets show that our method can successfully disentangle multi-modal
   labels, leading to state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on four XMC
   benchmarks.},

Abstract = {It takes a long time to generate a configuration for an FPGA starting
   from a description of a digital circuit in a hardware design language.
   This configuration should have a high quality so that the FPGA resources
   are used in an efficient way with the maximum clock frequency and
   minimizing the power consumption. In this work we present two new
   packing algorithms that obtain better quality and faster runtimes when
   compared to the frequently used AAPack packer. The partitioning based
   methodology allows us to exploit the advantage of multi-threading on
   commodity hardware. Firstly we demonstrate the benefits of our fully
   partitioning based PartSA packer. Existing packers with a partitioning
   based approach have problems with the cluster size and bandwidth
   constraint of the functional blocks. We added a fast simulated annealing
   step after partitioning to solve these problems. A gain of 26\% in total
   wirelength is obtained while reaching up to 2.3x faster packing runtimes
   for large circuits on a CPU with four cores. Unfortunately the PartSA
   packer can not be used for architectures without a complete crossbar in
   the functional blocks. Therefore a second packer is proposed that
   combines the benefits of partitioning based and seed based packing.
   MultiPart has up to 4x faster packing runtimes while still having a gain
   of 20\% in total wirelength.},

Title = {A partition-based optimization model and its performance benchmark for
   Generative Anatomy Modeling Language},
Journal = {COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE},
Year = {2020},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Background: This paper presents a novel iterative approach and rigorous
   accuracy testing for geometry modeling language - a Partition-based
   Optimization Model for Generative Anatomy Modeling Language (POM-GAML).
   POM-GAML is designed to model and create anatomical structures and their
   variations by satisfying any imposed geometric constraints using a
   non-linear optimization model. Model partitioning of POM-GAML creates
   smaller sub-problems of the original model to reduce the exponential
   execution time required to solve the constraints in linear time with a
   manageable error.
   Method: We analyzed our model concerning the iterative approach and
   graph parameters for different constraint hierarchies. The iteration was
   used to reduce the error for partitions and solve smaller sub-problems
   generated by various clustering/community detection algorithms. We
   empirically tested our model with eleven graph parameters. Graphs for
   each parameter with increasing constraint sets were generated to
   evaluate the accuracy of our method.
   Results: The average decrease in normalized error with respect to the
   original problem using cluster/community detection algorithms for
   constraint sets was above 63.97\%. The highest decrease in normalized
   error after five iterations for the constraint set of 3900 was 70.31\%,
   while the lowest decrease for the constraint set of 3000 was with
   63.97\%. Pearson correlation analysis between graph parameters and
   normalized error was carried out. We identified that graph parameters
   such as diameter, average eccentricity, global efficiency, and average
   local efficiency showed strong correlations to the normalized error.
   Conclusions: We observed that iteration monotonically decreases the
   error in all experiments. Our iteration results showed decreased
   normalized error using the partitioned constrained optimization by
   linear approximation to the non-linear optimization model.},

Abstract = {PageRank becomes the most well-known re-ranking technique of the search
   results. By its iterative computational nature, the computation takes
   much computing time and resource. Researchers have then devoted much
   attention in studying an efficient way to compute the PageRank scores of
   a very large web graph. However, only a few of them focus on large-scale
   PageRank computation using parallel processing techniques. In this
   paper, we propose a Partition-based parallel PageRank algorithm that can
   efficiently run on a low-cost parallel environment like the PC cluster.
   For comparison, we also study the other two known techniques, as well as
   propose an analytical discussion concerning I/O and synchronization
   cost, and memory usage. Experimental results with two web graphs
   synthesized from the .TH domain and the Stanford WebBase project are
   very promising.},

Abstract = {The growth and use of semantic web has led to a drastic increase in the
   size, heterogeneity and number of ontologies that are available on the
   web. Correspondingly, scalable ontology matching algorithms that will
   eliminate the heterogeneity among large ontologies have become a
   necessity. Ontology matching algorithms generally do not scale well due
   to the massive number of complex computations required to achieve
   matching. One of the methods used to address this problem is the use of
   partition-based systems to reduce the matching space. In this paper, we
   propose a new partitioning-based scalable ontology matching system
   called PSOM2. We have designed a new neighbour-based intra-similarity
   measure to increase the quality of the cluster set formation for the
   partition-based ontology matching process. These sets of clusters or
   sub-ontologies are matched across the input ontologies to identify
   matchable cluster pairs, based on anchors that are efficiently
   discovered through a new light-weight linguistic matcher (EI-sub).
   However, in order to further increase the efficiency of the
   time-consuming anchor discovery process we have designed a
   MapReduce-based EI-sub process where anchors are discovered in
   distributed and parallel fashion. Experiments on benchmark OAEI
   (Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative) large scale ontologies
   demonstrate that the new PSOM2 system achieves, on an average, 31\%
   decrease in entropy of the clusters and 54.5\% reduction in overall run
   time. Based on the experimental results, it is evident that the new
   PSOM2 achieves better quality clusters and a major reduction in
   execution time, leading to an effective and scalable ontology matching
   system.},

Abstract = {So far, clustering multi-hop routing algorithm has employed in many
   wireless sensor network routing protocols to improve the network
   performance. However, unreasonable clustering can cause premature death
   of cluster head. Given this, in the paper, we propose a pre-partition
   based uneven clustering multi-hop routing protocol (PUCMR), which can
   conserve energy efficiently. In the protocol, explicit numerical
   calculations for hierarchy numbers and size of each layer are provided.
   Non-uniform layering is adopted to balance energy consumption of cluster
   heads in different layers and energy consumption of cluster heads in the
   same layer. Simulation results show that the proposed protocol can well
   adapt to the large-scale condition, and balance cluster-head energy
   consumption, so as to prolong the life cycle of the network.},

Abstract = {Memory is one of the most restricted resources in embedded system. Code
   compression techniques address this issue by reducing the code size of
   programs. Huffman coding is the most common used coding method. But
   during the process of generating symbols from instruction, an
   experience-based partition way is usually used, which may cause
   information redundancy. This paper presents an Optimal-Partition Based
   Code Compression (OPCC) method. Markov tree model is used to extract
   correlation between bits in instruction. A clustering algorithm is
   proposed to cluster bits with higher correlation into symbols.
   Experimental results show that this method could improve the average
   compression ratio by 4.1\%. The decoder part is validated in Altera
   Cyclonell FPGA.(1)},

Abstract = {Conventional clustering algorithms based on the assumption that a data
   point can be assigned to only a single cluster. In spite of, there are
   several types of data that a data point belongs to multiple categories
   and causes ground-truth clusters overlap. To handle this situation,
   several algorithms are proposed and referred as ``overlapping
   clustering{''}. One of state-of-the-art partition-based overlapping
   clustering technique is ``Non-exhaustive, Overlapping K-Means{''} or
   ``NEO-K-Means{''} in short, which is an extension of K-Means clustering
   algorithm. Although NEO-K-Means works effectively for most real-world
   multi-category data. However, the process of assigning clusters focuses
   only on the minimum distance from the data to the centroid and ignores
   other essential parameters, such as, distance between clusters and the
   radius of clusters. Moreover, the number of estimation of data points on
   overlapping area is also still not accurate enough. These are huge draw
   backs of NEO-K-Means that makes clustering accuracy lower than it should
   be. In this paper, we aim to overcome this limitation in NEO-K-Means by
   using radius of cluster and distance between clusters for assisting in
   estimating data and assigning clusters. The experimental results show
   that our method significantly outperforms NEO-K-Means on nine real
   multi-category data sets in terms of F-1.},

Abstract = {As the size of databases has grown tremendously in modern times, it
   becomes very important to be able to extract meaningful information from
   enormous datasets, within a reasonable computation time. Accordingly,
   the data mining community has made efforts to enhance the scalability of
   most data mining algorithms, such as with clustering. Since the
   induction time of clustering algorithms is generally affected by the
   number of attributes and instances, a subset of instances is often used
   to improve the scalability. This paper suggests a scalable clustering
   algorithm with a two-stage statistical selection that extends the
   NP-based (Nested Partition-based) clustering method so as to make it
   into a tool to improve scalability. The two-stage NP-based clustering
   algorithm that we propose in this paper, (TS\_NPCLUSTER), augmented by
   properly adjusting the sample size of solutions in each partitioning
   region of the NP framework, has the capability to resolve noisy
   performance problems that arise when using a subset of instances. The
   two-stage sampling of TS\_NPCLUSTER can effectively resolve such
   problems as unwanted backtrackings caused by the noisy performance
   problem that are the critical cause of long induction times. The

Title = {Decision space partition based surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithm
   for expensive optimization},
Journal = {EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {214},
Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {In expensive optimization, function evaluations are based on expensive
   physical experiments or time consuming simulations. Moreover, the
   gradient for the objective is not readily available. Therefore, it is a
   challenge task to deal with expensive optimization. In this work, a
   decision space partition based surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithm
   (DSP-SAEA) is proposed for expensive optimization. In DSP-SAEA, a
   two-stage search strategy is introduced, where the global search and the
   local search are seamlessly integrated. In the global search stage, a
   decision space partition based global search strategy is proposed. In
   this strategy, all the exactly evaluated points are clustered into a set
   of clusters. Thus, the decision space can be partitioned into several
   regions based on the formed clusters. Furthermore, in each region, the
   surrogate model is constructed. The algorithm will search for these
   regions simultaneously with the help of the built surrogate models. As a
   result, several promising points distributed in different regions are
   able to be obtained. In the local search stage, a model adaptive
   selection strategy and the trust region local search are integrated. The
   model adaptive selection strategy is introduced to accurately assist the
   trust region local search, where the local elite surrogate model is
   adaptively chosen from the local surrogate model pool. Experimental
   results on benchmark problems and the parameter estimation for
   frequency-modulated sound waves problem demonstrate that DSP-SAEA
   performs competitively compared with some state-of-the-art algorithms.},

Abstract = {Clustering problem is an unsupervised learning problem. It is a
   procedure that partition data objects into matching clusters. The data
   objects in the same cluster are quite similar to each other and
   dissimilar in the other clusters. Density-based clustering algorithms
   find clusters based on density of data points in a region. DBSCAN
   algorithm is one of the density-based clustering algorithms. It can
   discover clusters with arbitrary shapes and only requires two input
   parameters. DBSCAN has been proved to be very effective for analyzing
   large and complex spatial databases. However, DBSCAN needs large volume
   of memory support and often has difficulties with high-dimensional data
   and clusters of very different densities. So, partitioning-based DBSCAN
   algorithm (PDBSCAN) was proposed to solve these problems. But PDBSCAN
   will get poor result when the density of data is non-uniform. Meanwhile,
   to some extent. DBSCAN and PDBSCAN are both sensitive to the initial
   parameters. In this paper, we propose a new hybrid algorithm based on
   PDBSCAN. We use modified ant clustering algorithm (ACA) and design a new
   partitioning algorithm based on `point density' (PD) in data
   preprocessing phase. We name the new hybrid algorithm PACA-DBSCAN. The
   performance of PACA-DBSCAN is compared with DBSCAN and PDBSCAN on five
   data sets. Experimental results indicate the superiority of PACA-DBSCAN
   algorithm. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {A clustering and partition based Boolean satisfiability solving method
   is proposed. By partitioning a CNF formula into several clause groups,
   satisfiability solving problem can be divided into small ones, so the
   complexity of the problem can be reduced. On the other hand, the
   satisliability of different clause groups can be solved in parallel, the
   decision procedure can be speeded up further. For the formula that
   cannot generate clause group partition directly, a clustering algorithm
   is given to clustering clauses into clusters. Then clause group
   partition can be generated by eliminating common variables among
   clusters. Further, a method based on minimum cut of undirected graph is
   given to make partition practical. Preliminary experiments shows that
   the common variables set among clusters is small for many SAT problems,
   and our approach can significantly increase the performance of SAT
   solving.},

Abstract = {Performance and scalability of distributed simulations depends primarily
   on the effectiveness of the employed data distribution management (DDM)
   algorithm, which aims at reducing the overall computational and
   messaging effort on the shared data to a necessary minimum. Existing DDM
   approaches, which are variations and combinations of two basic
   techniques, namely region-based and grid-based techniques, perform
   purely in the presence of load differences. We introduce the
   partition-based technique that allows for variable-size partitioning
   shared data. Based on this technique, a novel DDM algorithm is
   introduced that is dynamically adaptive to cluster formations in the
   shared data as well as in the physical location of the simulation
   objects. Since the re-distribution is sensitive to inter-relationships
   between shared data and simulation objects, a balanced constellation has
   the additional advantage to be of minimal messaging effort. Furthermore,
   dynamic system scalability is facilitated, as bottlenecks are avoided.},

Abstract = {We propose an online deterministic annealing algorithm for progressive
   graph partitioning based on the spectral information of the underlying
   graph Laplacian matrix. Online deterministic annealing is a
   prototype-based unsupervised learning algorithm that progressively
   adjusts the number of prototypes used with respect to a
   performance-complexity trade-off. Due to the online nature of the
   proposed learning algorithm, the structure of the graph need not be
   known a priori. In this regard, we construct a distributed approximation
   algorithm to estimate the spectral information of the graph Laplacian,
   bypassing the exact computation of its eigenvectors. By propagating an
   impulse through the graph via a diffusion equation, we show that each
   node can construct a local learning representation which can be used for
   spectral clustering. As a result, the proposed approach is suitable for
   large graphs, requires minimal hyper-parameter tuning, and provides
   online control over the complexity-accuracy trade-off. We illustrate the
   properties and evaluate the performance of the proposed methodology in
   graph partition and image segmentation applications.},

   improved Web documents clustering method, using genetic algorithm (GA)
   which introduces some ideas of ISODATA{[}6] into the design of its
   mutation operation. Experiments show that the GA's global search
   characteristic can avoid local optimum and the ISODATA-based mutation
   operation makes the improved clustering algorithm have the
   self-adjusting ability to discover clusters of different sizes.},

Abstract = {Module (or community) structure detection, which has been successfully
   applied to many fields, is vital step for understand network dynamic and
   complex systems. Module structure not only is a crucial character of
   networks, but also is multi-scale. Therefore, many multi-scale module
   detection algorithms are proposed to resolve the problem. But a highly
   important issue for multi-scale methods is that of how to select crucial
   partitions among multi-scale network partitions so that these partitions
   can effectively help people to understand complex system. To solve the
   problem, we propose a novel partition-based hierarchical clustering to
   select significant network partitions. Experiments on selection of
   benchmark and real networks demonstrate that the new method for
   selecting significant partitions is very effectively.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates the transmission design in fog radio access
   networks where each edge node (EN) has a local cache and can pre-store
   contents based on partition-based caching. In the considered
   partition-based caching, each file is partitioned into multiple subfiles
   and cached at different ENs. Upon user requests, the ENs can jointly
   transmit all the subfiles to the target users simultaneously. Each user
   adopts a successive interference cancellation receiver to decode each
   desired subfile with certain order. To improve the network performance,
   we propose a novel cache-aware scheme to determine the decoding order.
   Furthermore, we formulate a joint beamforming and dynamic EN clustering
   optimization problem to minimize the weighted sum of transmission power
   cost and fronthaul cost under the quality-of-service constraint for each
   user. An efficient algorithm by adopting smooth function approximation
   and convex-concave procedure is proposed to solve this problem. To
   exploit the advantages of partition-based caching, we further design a
   user-aware caching strategy. Numerical results show that the proposed
   transmission scheme together with the proposed caching strategy can
   strike a better balance between power consumption and fronthaul
   consumption than existing schemes.},

Abstract = {BackgroundThis paper presents a novel approach for Generative Anatomy
   Modeling Language (GAML). This approach automatically detects the
   geometric partitions in 3D anatomy that in turn speeds up integrated
   non-linear optimization model in GAML for 3D anatomy modeling with
   constraints (e.g. joints). This integrated non-linear optimization model
   requires the exponential execution time. However, our approach
   effectively computes the solution for non-linear optimization model and
   reduces computation time from exponential to linear time. This is
   achieved by grouping the 3D geometric constraints into
   communities.MethodsVarious community detection algorithms (k-means
   clustering, Clauset Newman Moore, and Density-Based Spatial Clustering
   of Applications with Noise) were used to find communities and partition
   the non-linear optimization problem into sub-problems. GAML was used to
   create a case study for 3D shoulder model to benchmark our approach with
   up to 5000 constraints.ResultsOur results show that the computation time
   was reduced from exponential time to linear time and the error rate
   between the partitioned and non-partitioned approach decreases with the
   increasing number of constraints. For the largest constraint set (5000
   constraints), speed up was over 2689-fold whereas error was computed as
   low as 2.2\%.ConclusionThis study presents a novel approach to group
   anatomical constraints in 3D human shoulder model using community
   detection algorithms. A case study for 3D modeling for shoulder models
   developed for arthroscopic rotator cuff simulation was presented. Our
   results significantly reduced the computation time in conjunction with a
   decrease in error using constrained optimization by linear
   approximation, non-linear optimization solver.},

   The results showed that the improved clustering algorithm was faster

Abstract = {conventional algorithms a data point can be assigned to only a single
   cluster. However, in reality there are several types of data that a data
   point belongs to multiple categories and causes ground-truth clusters
   overlap. In this circumstance, conventional clustering cannot work
   effectively. To handle this problem, several algorithms are proposed and
   referred as ``overlapping clustering{''}. One of state-of-the-art
   partition-based overlapping clustering technique is ``Nonexhaustive,
   Overlapping K-Means{''} or ``NEO-K-Means{''} in short, which is an
   extension of K-Means clustering algorithm. Although NEO-K-Means works
   effectively for most real-world multi-category data, however, distance
   between clusters that is essential parameter for overlapping clustering
   is not included in the process of algorithm. This is a huge drawback of
   NEO-K-Means that makes clustering accuracy lower than it should be. In
   this paper, we aim to overcome this limitation in NEO-K-Means with our
   assumption that closer clusters should have higher probability to
   overlap than others that are faraway. To achieve the goal, the parameter
   that represents distances between clusters centroids is included in
   objective function before prioritizing and assigning data points to the
   overlapped regions of clusters. The experimental results show that our
   method significantly outperforms NEO-K-Means on all nine real
   multi-category data sets in terms of F-1.},

Volume = {198},
Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {Partial least squares regression is one of the most popular modelling
   approaches for predicting spectral data and identifying key wavelengths
   when combining with many variable selection methods. But some
   traditional variable selection approaches often overlook the local or
   group information between the covariates. In this paper, a
   partition-based variable selection in partial least squares (PARPLS)
   method is proposed. It first uses the k-means algorithm to part the
   variable space and then estimates the coefficients in each group.
   Finally, these coefficients are sorted to select the important
   variables. The results on three near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy
   datasets show that the PARPLS is able to obtain better prediction
   performance and more effective variables than its competitors.},

Abstract = {The IoT and its applications are the inseparable part of modern world.
   IoT is expanding into every corner of the world where internet is
   available. IoT data streams are utilized by many organizations for
   research and business. To benefit from these data streams, the data
   handling party must secure the individuals' privacy. The most common
   privacy preservation approach is data anonymization. However, IoT data
   provides missing data streams due to the varying device pool and
   preferences of individuals and unpredicted devices' malfunctions of IoT.
   Minimization of missingess and information loss is very important for
   anonymizing of missing data streams. To achieve this, we introduce
   IncrementalPBM (Incremental Partitioning Based Marginalization) for
   anonymizing missig data streams. IncrementalPBM utilizes time based
   sliding window for missing data stream anonymization, and it aims to
   control the number of QIDs for anonymization while increasing the number
   of tuples for anonymization. Our experiment on real dataset showed
   IncrementalPBM is effective and efficient for anonymizing missing data
   streams compared to existing missing data stream anonymization
   algorithm. IncrementalPBM showed significant improvement; 5\% to 9\%
   less information loss, 4500 to 6000 more number of re-use anonymization
   while showing comparable clustering, suppression and runtime.},

Title = {Cluster Partition-Based Zonal Voltage Control for Distribution Networks
   With High Penetrated PVs},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ENERGY RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {MAY 2},
Abstract = {With the high penetrated photovoltaics (PVs) accessing distribution
   networks (DNs) in the future, the overvoltage of distribution network
   will be more serious, and the voltage control will be more complex. To
   solve this problem, a cluster partition-based zonal voltage control
   method for DN is proposed in this study. First, a cluster partition
   method using a comprehensive performance index is proposed: in terms of
   DN structure, a global density quality function index is introduced to
   measure the coupling degree of nodes in clusters. In terms of cluster
   function, the inconsistency coefficient index is presented to reflect
   the PV output characteristics, and a node membership function index is
   presented to limit the scale of the cluster. Then, the DN cluster
   partition is carried out under the fast Newman (FN) algorithm. Second, a
   second-order cone programming (SOCP) model of voltage control is
   established to maximize the PV consumption in each cluster. To achieve

Title = {A modified Fuzzy k-Partition based on indiscernibility relation for
   categorical data clustering},
Journal = {ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {53},

Abstract = {Categorical data clustering has been adopted by many scientific
   communities to classify objects from large databases. In order to
   classify the objects, Fuzzy k-Partition approach has been proposed for
   categorical data clustering. However, existing Fuzzy k-Partition
   approaches suffer from high computational time and low clustering
   accuracy. Moreover, the parameter maximize of the classification
   likelihood function in Fuzzy k-Partition approach will always have the
   same categories, hence producing the same results. To overcome these
   issues, we propose a modified Fuzzy k-Partition based on
   indiscernibility relation. The indiscernibility relation induces an
   approximation space which is constructed by equivalence classes of
   indiscernible objects, thus it can be applied to classify categorical
   data. The novelty of the proposed approach is that unlike previous
   approach that use the likelihood function of multivariate multinomial
   distributions, the proposed approach is based on indescernibility
   relation. We performed an extensive theoretical analysis of the proposed
   approach to show its effectiveness in achieving lower computational
   complexity. Further, we compared the proposed approach with Fuzzy
   Centroid and Fuzzy k-Partition approaches in terms of response time and
   clustering accuracy on several UCI benchmark and real world datasets.
   The results show that the proposed approach achieves lower response time
   and higher clustering accuracy as compared to other Fuzzy k-based
   approaches. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Microarray experiments normally produce data sets with multiple missing
   expression values, due to various experimental problems. Unfortunately,
   many algorithms for gene expression analysis require a complete matrix
   of gene expression values as input. Therefore, effective missing value
   estimation methods are needed to minimize the effect of incomplete data
   during analysis of gene expression data using these algorithms. In this
   paper, missing values in different microarray data sets are estimated
   using different partition-based clustering algorithms to emphasize the
   fact that clustering based methods are also useful tool for prediction
   of missing values. However, clustering approaches have not been yet
   highlighted to predict missing values in gene expression data. The
   estimation accuracy of different clustering methods are compared with
   the widely used KNNimpute and SKNNimpute methods on various microarray
   data sets with different rate of missing entries. The experimental
   results show the effectiveness of clustering based methods compared to
   other existing methods in terms of Root Mean Square error.},

Abstract = {Considering the possible overvoltage caused by high-penetration
   photovoltaics (PVs) connected to the distribution networks (DNs), a
   cluster partition-based voltage control combined day-ahead scheduling
   and real-time control for distribution networks is proposed. Firstly, a
   community detection algorithm utilizing a coupling quality function is
   introduced to divide the PVs into clusters. Based on the cluster
   partition, day-ahead scheduling (DAS) is proposed with the objective of
   minimizing the operating costs of PVs, as well as the on-load tap
   changer (OLTC). In the real-time control, a second-order cone
   programming (SOCP) model-based real-time voltage control (RTVC) strategy
   is drawn up in each cluster to regulate the PV inverters, and this
   strategy can correct the day-ahead scheduling by modifications. The
   proposed strategy realizes the combination of day-ahead scheduling and
   real-time voltage control, and the optimization of voltage control can
   be greatly simplified. Finally, the proposed method is applied to a
   practical 10 kV feeder to verify its effectiveness.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we study the area-balanced multiway partitioning problem
   of VLSI circuits based on a new dual netlist representation named the
   hybrid dual netlist (HDN), and propose a general paradigm for multiway
   circuit partitioning based on dual net transformation, Given a netlist,
   we first compute a K-way partitioning of nets based on the HDN
   representation, and then transform the K-way net partition into a K-way
   module partitioning solution, The main contribution of our paper is in
   the formulation and solution of the ii-way module contention (K-MC)
   problem, which determines the best assignment of the modules in
   contention to partitions while maintaining user-specified area
   requirements when we transform the net partition into a module
   partition. Under a natural definition of binding function between nets
   and modules, and preference function between partitions and modules, we
   show that the ii-MG problem can be reduced to a min-cost max-flow
   problem, We present an efficient solution to the ii-MG problem based on
   network flow computation, We apply our dual. transformation paradigm to
   the well-known ii-way Fiduccia-Mattheyses (FM) partitioning algorithm
   (K-FM) and show that the new algorithm, named K-DualFM, reduces the net
   cutsize by 20\% to 31\% compared with the K-FM algorithm, We also apply
   the same paradigm to the ii-maximum fanout-free cone (MFFC)-FM
   algorithm, a K-FM algorithm based on MFFC clustering, and show that the
   resulting algorithm, K-DualMFFC-FM reduces the net cutsize by 15\% to
   26\% compared with K-MFFC-FM. Furthermore, we compare the K-DualFM
   algorithm with EIG1 and Paraboli, two recently proposed spectral-based
   bipartitioning algorithms, We showed that K-DualFM reduces the net
   cutsize by 56\% on average when compared with EIG1 and produces
   comparable results with Paraboli.},

Abstract = {Clustering techniques have been used by many intelligent software agents
   in order to retrieve, filter, and categorize documents available on the
   World Wide Web. Clustering is also useful in extracting salient features
   of related Web documents to automatically formulate queries and search
   for other similar documents on the Web. Traditional clustering
   algorithms either use a priori knowledge of document structures to
   define a distance or similarity among these documents, or use
   probabilistic techniques such as Bayesian classification. Many of these
   traditional algorithms, however, falter when the dimensionality of the
   feature space becomes high relative to the size of the document space.
   In this paper, we introduce two new clustering algorithms that can
   effectively cluster documents, even in the presence of a very high
   dimensional feature space. These clustering techniques, which are based
   on generalizations of graph partitioning, do not require pre-specified
   ad hoc distance functions, and are capable of automatically discovering
   document similarities or associations. We conduct several experiments on
   real Web data using various feature selection heuristics, and compare
   our clustering schemes to standard distance-based techniques, such as
   hierarchical agglomeration clustering, and Bayesian classification
   methods, such as AutoClass. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Title = {From Partition Based Clustering to Density Based Clustering: Fast Find
   Clusters With Diverse Shapes and Densities in Spatial Databases},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {6},
Pages = {1718-1729},
Abstract = {Spatial data clustering has played an important role in the knowledge
   discovery in spatial databases. However, due to the increasing volume
   and diversity of data, conventional spatial clustering methods are
   inefficient even on moderately large data sets, and usually fail to
   discover clusters with diverse shapes and densities, To address these
   challenges, we propose a two-phase clustering method named KMDD
   (clustering by combining K-means with density and distance-based method)
   to fast find clusters with diverse shapes and densities in spatial
   databases. In the first phase, KMDD uses a partition-based algorithm
   (K-means) to cluster the data set into several relatively small
   spherical or ball-shaped subclusters. After that, each subcluster is
   given a local density; to merge subclusters, KMDD utilizes the idea that
   genuine cluster cores are characterized by a higher density than their
   neighbor subclusters and by a relatively large distance from subclusters
   with higher densities. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and
   real-world data sets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has a
   near-linear time complexity with respect to the data set size and
   dimension, and has the capability to find clusters with diverse shapes
   and densities,},

Abstract = {The advent of underwater acoustic sensor networks (UASNs) has enhanced
   marine environmental monitoring, auxiliary navigation, and marine
   military defense. One of the core functions of UASNs is data collection.
   However, current underwater data collection schemes generally encounter
   problems such as high energy consumption and high latency. Furthermore,
   the application of multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) has
   contributed to more problems of task assignment and load balancing. This
   leads to significant failure in data collections and controlling of
   spontaneous emergencies. To address these problems, a district
   partition-based data collection algorithm with event dynamic competition
   in UASNs has been proposed. In this algorithm, the value of information
   of the packet determines the priority of its transmission to the cluster
   head. The navigation position of the mobile sink and the area under the
   responsibility of each AUV are determined by the spatial region
   division. The path of the AUV in the subregion is then planned using
   reinforcement learning. Subsequently, the dynamic competition of
   multiple AUVs is used to handle emergency tasks. The simulation
   demonstrates that our proposed algorithm significantly reduces energy
   consumption to guarantee load balancing while reducing end-to-end
   transmission delay.},

Abstract = {Voltage Control Areas (VCAs) dividing is the basis of secondary voltage
   control, but the traditional methods have some disadvantages such as the
   complexity of calculation and determination of the number of VCAs. At
   first This paper proposes a voltage partition method based on spectral
   coefficient clustering algorithm in which the concept of average
   distance was used, and then with the application of some statistical
   indicators, the criteria for judging the best result of voltage
   partition was also introduced. At last a case study based on a practical
   system was provided to show its validity and reliability.},

Abstract = {Today's life entirely depends on information, and security in
   information system is an essential term. Now a days various biometric
   feature like fingerprint, gait, iris, face etc. are used to secure any
   system and it is more powerful to use biometric feature instead of using
   other traditional techniques like password, PIN number etc. In automated
   personal identification system iris recognition technique is the most
   reliable authentication technique and iris image segmentation step is
   important to acquire good accuracy in this technique. But noisy image
   decrease the accuracy and most of the errors occur in non-iris region.
   So it is better to avoid segmentation errors by excluding non-iris
   regions from iris image. On the other hand cluster analysis one of the
   data mining concepts, is very useful for finding similar groups from a
   data set. So cluster analysis can be used for finding relevant groups
   from iris image. Basically k-means clustering algorithm used on
   segmentation step. In this thesis work another two clustering algorithms
   has been used for iris image preprocessing on segmentation step to
   cluster most similar objects together so that non-iris region can be
   reduced and compare their performance with k-means algorithm to find out
   the better one.},

Abstract = {A Parallel Constructing-Density-Tree Clustering Algorithm based on Data
   Partitioning (PCAP) was presented The PCAP automatically partitioned
   global data space into load-balanced subspaces, which were distributed
   to different processors to complete subspaces' clustering. The
   clustering result of global data space was achieved by merging those
   strong-association clusters though checking the association-intensity of
   leaves' similarity. The detailed method of computing the
   association-intensity between clusters was described Finally, the
   relevancy of the speedup and the amount of processors were discussed The
   experiment results on artificial and real datasets show PCAP realizes
   the parallel of constructing-density-tree clustering algorithm and
   improves the clustering speed efficiently under preserving enough
   clustering precision. This approach is more suitable for dealing with
   great amounts of datasets.},

Abstract = {Data stream clustering with sliding windows generates clusters for every
   window movement. Because repeated clustering on all changed windows is
   highly inefficient in terms of memory and computation time, a clustering
   algorithm should be designed with considering only inserted and deleted
   tuples of windows. In this paper, we address this problem by sliding
   window aggregation technique and cluster modification strategy. We
   propose a novel data structure for construction and maintenance of
   2-level synopses. This data structure enables to update synopses
   efficiently and support precise sliding window operations. We also
   suggest a modification strategy to decide whether to append new synopses
   to pre-existing clusters or perform clustering on whole synopses
   according to the difference between probability distributions of the
   original and updated clusters. Experimental results show that proposed
   method outperforms state-of-the-art methods.},

Abstract = {Several fast algorithms for clustering very large data sets have been
   proposed in the literature, including CLARA, CLARANS, GAC-R-3, and
   GAC-RAR(w). CLARA is a combination of a sampling procedure and the
   classical PAM algorithm, while CLARANS adopts a serial randomized search
   strategy to find the optimal set of medoids. GAC-R-3 and GAC-RAR(w)
   exploit genetic search heuristics for solving clustering problems. In
   this research, we conducted an empirical comparison of these four
   clustering algorithms over a wide range of data characteristics
   described by data size, number of clusters, cluster distinctness,
   cluster asymmetry, and data randomness. According to the experimental
   results, CLARANS outperforms its counterparts both in clustering quality
   and execution time when the number of clusters increases, clusters are
   more closely related, more asymmetric clusters are present, or more
   random objects exist in the data set. With a specific number of
   clusters, CLARA can efficiently achieve satisfactory clustering quality
   when the data size is larger, whereas GAC-R-3 and GAC-RAR(w) can achieve
   satisfactory clustering quality and efficiency when the data size is
   small, the number of clusters is small, and clusters are more distinct
   and symmetric. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Cluster structure detection of the network is a basic problem of complex
   network analysis. This study investigates the structure of the value
   migration network using data from 499 stocks listed in the S\&P500 as of
   the end of 2021. An examination is carried out whether the process of
   value migration creates a cluster structure in the network of companies
   according to economic activity. Specifically, the cohesion and
   segregation of the extracted modules in the network division according
   to (i) sector classification, (ii) community division, and (iii) network
   clustering decomposition are assessed. The results of this study show
   that the sector classification of the value migration network has a
   non-cohesive structure, which means that the flow of value in the
   financial market occurs between companies from various industries.
   Moreover, the divisions of the value migration network based on
   community detection and clustering algorithm are characterized by
   intra-cluster similarity between the vertices and have a strong
   community structure. The structure of the network division into modules
   corresponding to the classification of economic sectors differs
   significantly from the partition based on the algorithms applied.},

Title = {A Partitioning Based Algorithm to Fuzzy Tricluster},
Journal = {MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {2015},
Abstract = {Fuzzy clustering allows an object to exist in multiple clusters and
   represents the affiliation of objects to clusters by memberships. It is
   extended to fuzzy coclustering by assigning both objects and features
   membership functions. In this paper we propose a new fuzzy triclustering
   (FTC) algorithm for automatic categorization of three-dimensional data
   collections. FTC specifies membership function for each dimension and is
   able to generate fuzzy clusters simultaneously on three dimensions. Thus
   FTC divides a three-dimensional cube into many little blocks which
   should be triclusters with strong coherent bonding among its members.
   The experimental studies on MovieLens demonstrate the strength of FTC in
   terms of accuracy compared to some recent popular fuzzy clustering and
   coclustering approaches.},

Abstract = {In this paper, a new dynamic clustering algorithm based on random
   sampling is proposed. The algorithm addresses well known challenges in
   clustering such as Dynamism, Stability, and Scaling. The core of the
   proposed method is based on the definition of a function, named the
   Oracle, which can predict whether two random data points belong to the
   same cluster or not. Furthermore, this algorithm is also equipped with a
   novel technique for determination of the optimal number of clusters in
   datasets. These properties add the capabilities of high performance and
   reducing the effect of scale in datasets to this algorithm. Finally, the
   algorithm is tuned and evaluated by means of various experiments and
   in-depth analysis. High accuracy and performance results obtained,
   demonstrate the competitiveness of our algorithm.},

Abstract = {The partitioning of water distribution system is a complex process
   achieved defining network clusters arranged in sectors, with the
   complete isolation of clusters through gate valves, or arranged in
   districts, inserting both gate valves and flow meters. The process is
   generally subdivided in two phases: clustering, aimed to define the
   shape and dimension of network clusters, and partitioning, aimed to
   select pipes in which to insert flow meters or gate valves. In this
   paper, different clustering procedures based on social network community
   detection and on graph partitioning algorithms, were compared using a
   real water system and a large battery of performance indices. (C) 2015

Abstract = {In many popular applications like peer-to-peer systems, large amounts of
   data are distributed among multiple sources. Analysis of this data and
   identifying clusters is challenging due to processing, storage, and
   transmission costs. In this paper, we propose GDCluster, a general fully
   decentralized clustering method, which is capable of clustering dynamic
   and distributed data sets. Nodes continuously cooperate through
   decentralized gossip-based communication to maintain summarized views of
   the data set. We customize GDCluster for execution of the
   partition-based and density-based clustering methods on the summarized
   views, and also offer enhancements to the basic algorithm. Coping with
   dynamic data is made possible by gradually adapting the clustering
   model. Our experimental evaluations show that GDCluster can discover the
   clusters efficiently with scalable transmission cost, and also expose
   its supremacy in comparison to the popular method LSP2P.},

Abstract = {In this work, image-space-parallel direct volume rendering (DVR) of
   unstructured grids is investigated for distributed-memory architectures.
   A hypergraph-partitioning-based model is proposed for the adaptive
   screen partitioning problem in this context. The proposed model aims to
   balance the rendering loads of processors while trying to minimize the
   amount of data replication. In the parallel DVR framework we adopted,
   each data primitive is statically owned by its home processor, which is
   responsible from replicating its primitives on other processors. Two
   appropriate remapping models are proposed by enhancing the above model
   for use within this framework. These two remapping models aim to
   minimize the total volume of communication in data replication while
   balancing the rendering loads of processors. Based on the proposed
   models, a parallel DVR algorithm is developed. The experiments conducted
   on a PC cluster show that the proposed remapping models achieve better
   speedup values compared to the remapping models previously suggested for
   image-space-parallel DVR.},

   disjoint cluster. The basic concept behind clustering is that the data
   objects in the same clusters should be related to each other and the
   data objects belonging to different clusters should differ from each
   other. This research paper proposes a new algorithm which combines the
   features of K-means clustering algorithm and Hierarchical clustering
   algorithm BIRCH. The proposed algorithm first perform hierarchical
   clustering on the dataset which gives a large number of clusters and
   then further perform partitioning clustering using K-Means partitioning
   clustering algorithm to reduce the number of clusters and get more
   accuracy. The proposed algorithm is applied on cars dataset which is
   then compared with K-means clustering algorithm. The comparison is done
   on the basis of within sum square error in which the new algorithm give
   better results as compare to K-Means clustering algorithms.},

Abstract = {A wireless body area network (WBAN) is a physical network system with
   functions such as information collection and data transmission, and
   provides a key means for real-time health detection and medical
   services. However, if WBANs deployed in a dense environment lack
   internetwork coordination, it can cause high interference. In addition,
   WBANs have the characteristics of social mobility, and regular frequency
   changes will increase energy consumption. In this article, the
   co-frequency interference between coexisting WBANs in dense environments
   is analyzed, and the real-time frequency of mobile WBANs is studied
   emphatically to alleviate these problems. A spectrum allocation scheme
   for intelligent partition based on machine learning is proposed as a
   mixed scheduling scheme that combines graph coloring and partitioning
   ideas. WBANs' self-organized dynamic clustering forms multiple cells
   according to location, and the cells use a vertex coloring algorithm of
   self-generating topological graphs to coordinate their frequency bands
   and assign different colors to coexisting cells. When a new user joins
   the area, it will self-organize and cluster to a divided cell, and the
   cell will divide frequency bands for the new user. No other bands need
   to be changed, and the experiments conducted in this research
   demonstrate that the proposed arithmetic can adapt well to the
   fast-changing WBANs of the topology, and the system anti-interference
   performance, frequency resource utilization, and system stability are

Abstract = {Virtual request partitioning is an essential subproblem of two common
   problems in virtual networks, namely, virtual network embedding (VNE)
   and virtual machine placement (VMP). In this study, we consider a
   network-aware variant of the problem where the objective is to partition
   a virtual request so as to minimize the total amount of inter-cluster
   traffic. This problem is equivalent to the (k,u)- balanced partitioning
   problem, an NP-complete problem. To handle the inherent complexity of
   this problem, we develop a spectral clustering-based partitioning scheme
   that produces good solutions in a reasonable amount of time. Our
   solution consists of several components: (a) spectral clustering, (b) a
   constrained k-means partitioning algorithm that ensures that capacity
   limits for clusters are met, and for which we present a polynomial-time
   greedy algorithm, and (c) a greedy refinement algorithm using simulated
   annealing to further improve the clustering solution. Simulation results
   indicate that our algorithm outperforms existing partitioning schemes in
   terms of inter-cluster traffic minimization.},

Abstract = {Water Network Partitioning (WNP) in District Meter Area (DMA), obtained
   inserting remote control valves and flow meters in water supply systems,
   allows simplifying the water balance and pressure control in order to
   reduce water leakage and to improve water quality protection.
   Traditionally, the WNP is based on empirical suggestions and on trial
   and error approaches used with hydraulic simulation software, difficult
   to apply to large networks. Recently, some heuristic procedures, based
   on graph and network theory, have shown that it is possible to find
   optimal solutions in terms of number, shape and dimension of DMAs. In
   this paper, spectral clustering theory was used to define the water
   districts, taking into account the spatial and hydraulic constraints,
   through weight matrices. A comparison between different spectral
   clustering methods was achieved on a real water network measuring some
   energy performance indices, in order to identify the optimal water
   network partitioning.},

Title = {Power Grid Partitioning Based on Functional Community Structure},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Pages = {152624-152634},
Abstract = {Network partitioning is a popular research topic. Not all available
   partitioning methods are equally suitable for power grids. Community
   detection is a critical issue in complex network theory, and power grid
   is a typical type of complex network. This paper proposes a functional
   community structure based on an extended weighted network model. An
   extended adjacency matrix is used to represent an extended weighted
   complex network model based on coupling strength rather than the
   conventional adjacency matrix. Meanwhile, we upgraded the Newman fast
   algorithm of community detection for establishing a novel power grid
   partitioning algorithm. The electrical coupling strength (ECS) is
   defined to better reflect electrical characteristics between any two
   nodes in power grid. Modularity is also redefined as electrical
   modularity based on ECS. The Newman fast algorithm is upgraded with
   electrical modularity maximization as the objective to detect functional
   communities in power grids. A case study on IEEE test systems with 30,
   39, 118, 300 buses and one Italian power network demonstrates the
   rationality of the extended weighted network model and partitioning
   algorithm.},

Abstract = {As one of the most popular clustering techniques for high dimensional
   data, soft subspace clustering (SSC) algorithms have been receiving a
   great deal of attention in recent years. Unfortunately, most existing
   works do not cluster high dimensional sparse data and noisy data in an
   effective manner. In this study, a novel soft subspace clustering
   algorithm called PI-SSC is proposed. By introducing a partition index
   (PI) into the objective function, a novel soft subspace clustering
   algorithm that combines the concepts of hard and fuzzy clustering is
   proposed. Furthermore, the robust property of PI-SSC is analyzed from
   the viewpoint of a-insensitive distance. A convergence theorem for
   PI-SSC is also established by applying Zangwill's convergence theorem.
   The results of the experiment demonstrate the effectiveness of the
   proposed algorithm in high dimensional sparse text data and noisy
   texture data. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Volume = {13},

Month = {APR 11},
Abstract = {Data clustering belongs to the category of unsupervised learning and
   plays an important role in the dynamic systems and big data. The
   clustering problem of sampled time-series data is undoubtedly much more
   challenging than that of repeatable sampling data. Most of the existing
   time-series clustering methods stay at the level of algorithm design,
   lacking rigorous theoretical foundation and being inefficient in dealing
   with large-scale time series. To address this issue, in this paper, we
   establish the mathematical theory for the large-scale time series
   clustering of dynamic system. The main contributions of this paper
   include proposing the concept of time series morphological isomorphism,
   proving that translation isomorphism and stretching isomorphism are
   equivalent relations, developing the calculation method of morphological
   similarity measure, and establishing a new time series clustering method
   based on equivalent partition and morphological similarity. These
   contributions provide a new theoretical foundation and practical method
   for the clustering of large-scale time series. Simulation results in
   typical applications verify the validity and practicability of the
   aforementioned clustering methods.},

Abstract = {As data mining having become increasingly important, clustering
   algorithms with lots of applications have attracted a significant amount
   of research attention in recent decades. There are many different
   clustering techniques having been proposed. Some conventional
   partitioning-based clustering methods, such as K-means, may fail if a
   set of incorrect parameters is chosen, or breakdown when the objects
   consist of non-spherical patterns. Although density-based approaches,
   e.g. DBSCAN and IDBSCAN, could deliver better results, they may increase
   time cost when using large data bases. In this investigation, a new
   clustering algorithm termed DenVOICE is provided to circumvent the
   problems stated above. As a hybrid technique that combines
   density-partitioning clustering concept, the proposed algorithm is
   capable of resulting in precise pattern recognition while decreasing
   time cost. Experiments illustrate that the new algorithm can recognize
   arbitrary patterns, and efficiently eliminate the problem of long
   computational time when employing large data bases. It also indicates
   that the proposed approach produces much smaller errors than K-means,.

Abstract = {Clustering for hyperspectral images (HSIs) is a very challenging task
   because HSIs usually have large spectral variability, high
   dimensionality, and complex structures. Recently, the sparse
   representation and dictionary-learning-based spectral clustering (SC)
   approaches have achieved great success in clustering HSIs. However, SC
   deals with hyperspectral clustering by one-way clustering, i.e., either
   dictionary atoms or sparse-representation-based clustering, and only
   clusters the columns information of adjacency matrix. To overcome these
   problems, we propose a novel coclustering based on bipartite graph
   partition (BGP) with joint sparsity for two disjoint sets: dictionary
   atoms and hyperspectral pixels. First, the structured dictionary
   constraint is incorporated into a unified joint sparsity constrained
   optimizing model to learn a structured sparse representation by
   incorporating spectral and contextual characteristics of HSIs where the
   joint sparsity coefficients provide related information between
   hyperspectral pixels and dictionary atoms. Then, a BGP-based classifier
   is proposed to simultaneously group hyperspectral pixels with the
   learned dictionary atoms by mapping the joint sparsity coefficients to a
   non-negative affinity matrix of graph, and simultaneously clusters rows
   and columns information of adjacency matrix. To solve the BGP problem,
   we use spectral graph partition algorithm, which uses the left and right
   singular vectors of an appropriately dictionary-signal adjacent matrix
   to yield good bipartitionings and the singular vectors solve a real
   relaxation of the NP-complete BGP problem. The proposed algorithm was
   tested on three widely used hyperspectral datasets, and experimental
   results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms other
   state-of-the-art methods.},

Abstract = {We propose a novel clustering algorithm that is similar in spirit to
   classification trees. The data is recursively split using a criterion
   that applies a discrete curve evolution method to the histogram of
   distances. The algorithm can be depicted through tree diagrams with
   triple splits. Leaf nodes represent either clusters or sets of
   observations that can not yet be clearly assigned to a cluster After
   constructing the tree, unclassified data points are mapped to their
   closest clusters. The algorithm has several advantages. First, it deals
   effectively with observations that can not be unambiguously assigned to
   a cluster by allowing a ``margin of error{''}. Second, it automatically
   determines the number of clusters; apart from the margin of error the
   user only needs to specify the minimal cluster size but not the number
   of clusters. Third, it is linear with respect to the number of data
   points and thus suitable for very large data sets. Experiments involving
   both simulated and real data from different domains show that the
   proposed method is effective and efficient.},

Title = {An optimal allocation method for power distribution network partitions
   based on improved spectral clustering algorithm},
Journal = {ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {123},
Number = {C},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Distribution network nodes are numerous and monitoring devices are
   widely distributed. All monitoring data are uploaded to the cloud master
   for centralized processing may cause serious problems, such as network
   congestion, information delay and high computational complexity. The
   edge computing can provide a good solution, which requires reasonable
   distribution network partition. This paper proposes a Monte Carlo
   optimized spectral clustering (MCOSC) distribution network partition
   method for edge server configuration. Firstly, the objective function of
   distribution network partition number is constructed with economic and
   real-time communication indexes, which are more suitable for edge
   computing than electrical distance and voltage sensitivity indexes. Then
   the optimal number of partitions is obtained by particle swarm
   optimization (PSO) with the constraints of communication reliability.
   Secondly, to solve the problem that the traditional spectral clustering
   is easy to fall into the local optimal solution, a Monte Carlo optimized
   spectral clustering method is proposed to make the distribution network
   partition results more reasonable. Finally, the performance of the
   proposed method is evaluated by IEEE 33 bus and 69 bus systems
   distribution network models. The results indicate that the Monte Carlo
   optimization partition method has better accurate, robustness and
   convergence speed than traditional spectral clustering method.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS},

Volume = {31},

Month = {MAY 25},
Abstract = {Wireless passive sensor networks play an important role in solving the
   energy limitation of nodes in the Internet of Things, and node
   scheduling is a significant method used to improve the energy
   utilization of nodes. In this work, an unused energy model based on
   analyzing the energy consumption characteristics of passive nodes is
   proposed because no unified model of passive sensor nodes is reported in
   previous studies. A rapid square partition clustering method is proposed
   according to the analysis of the relation between the sensing and
   communication radii of nodes, and the secondary grouping and node
   scheduling in each cluster are implemented to ensure the coverage rate
   of networks. Experimental results show that the state distribution of
   nodes in the proposed algorithm is favorable. The performance of the
   proposed algorithm is significantly affected by the P ratio between the
   working and charging powers of nodes. When the value of P is less than
   100, the network coverage and connectivity rate are maintained at more
   than 95\% and 90\%, respectively, and are both higher than the existing
   algorithm.},

Abstract = {Data is humongous today because of the extensive use of World Wide Web,

   Mining method which divides the data points into different groups such
   that all similar data points form a part of the same group. Clustering
   methods are of various types. Many parameters and indexes exist for the
   evalua-tion and comparison of these methods. In this paper, we have
   compared partition-ing based methods K-Means, Fuzzy C-Means (FCM),
   Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM) and Clustering Large Application
   (CLARA) on secure perturbed data. Comparison and identification has been
   done for the method which performs better for analyzing the data

   Identification Using an Improved Spectral Clustering Algorithm},
Journal = {ELECTRONICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {10},
Number = {17},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The ever-expanding power system is developed into an interconnected
   pattern of power grids. Zone partitioning is an essential technique for
   the operation and management of such an interconnected power system.
   Owing to the transmission capacity limitation, transmission congestion
   may occur with a regional influence on power system. If transmission
   congestion is considered when the system is decomposed into several
   regions, the power consumption structure can be optimized and power
   system planning can be more reasonable. At the same time, power
   resources can be properly allocated and system safety can be improved.
   In this paper, we propose a power system zone partitioning method where
   the potential congested branches are identified and the spectral
   clustering algorithm is improved. We transform the zone partitioning
   problem into a graph segmentation problem by constructing an undirected
   weighted graph of power system where the similarities between buses are
   measured by the power transfer distribution factor (PTDF) corresponding
   to the potential congested branches. Zone partitioning results show that
   the locational marginal price (LMP) in the same zone is similar, which
   can represent regional price signals and provide regional auxiliary
   decisions.},

   nonlinear function. Membership random selection is featured by an
   iterative process, which results in local optima traps easily. It is
   important to find global optimal consider to nonlinear objective
   function of the problem. Moreover, Artificial Bee colony (ABC) has
   ability and efficiently used for multivariable, multinomial function
   optimization. To this, this paper proposes the hybridization of FkP
   based on Artificial Bee colony (ABC) a population based algorithm. Some
   of benchmarks data sets have been elaborated to test the proposed
   approach. The experiment shows that FkP ABC obtains better results in
   term of the dun index validity clustering as compared to the baseline
   algorithm.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a new design of fuzzy neural networks (FNNs) based

   The proposed FNNs are expressed by the scatter partition of input space
   generated by fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm. The partitioned local
   spaces indicate the fuzzy rules of the FNNs that have the individual
   regions in the different size. The consequence part of the rule is
   represented by polynomial functions. The back propagation algorithm is
   used to estimate the coefficients of the polynomial functions. The
   optimisation to find individual regions and parameters of learning is
   conducted by PSO. The performance of the proposed FNNs is demonstrated
   with the non-linear process.},

Abstract = {Feature selection is fundamentally an optimization problem for selecting
   relevant features from several alternatives in clustering problems.
   Though several algorithms have been suggested, however till this day,
   there has not been any one of those that has been dubbed as the best for
   every problem scenario. Therefore, researchers continue to strive in
   developing superior algorithms. Even though clustering process is
   considered a pre-processing task but what it really does is just
   dividing the data into groups. In this paper we have attempted an
   improved distance function to cluster mixed data. A similarity measure
   for mixed data is Gower distance is adopted and modified to define the
   similarity between object pairs. A partitional algorithm for mixed data
   is employed to group similar objects in clusters. The performance of the
   proposed method has been evaluated on similar mixed and real educational
   dataset in terms of the silhouette coefficient. Results reveal the
   effectiveness of this algorithm in unsupervised discovery problems. The
   proposed algorithm performed better than other clustering algorithms for

Year = {2005},
Volume = {67},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Partitioning free-form surfaces into sub-patches and finding optimal
   representative normal for each patch to maximize a global objective
   function is an important two-level operation in diverse industrial
   applications. In this paper, by solving a maximum hemispherical
   partitioning problem raised from a weighted Gaussian image, an
   optimization algorithm is proposed to partition a free-form surface into
   two sub-patches and simultaneously report the optimal representative
   normals. By discretizing the free-form surface with W sample points and
   clustering normals on the surface with m distinct sample normals, the
   proposed algorithm is designed, in general, with O(m(2)W(2)) time
   complexity and O(V) space complexity, and in particular, if the surface
   is convex, in O(m(2)logm) time complexity. Case studies with four
   representative examples are presented and a real world application is
   exploited to demonstrate the effectiveness and usefulness of the
   proposed algorithm. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The data analysis is closely related to data attribute dimension. The
   traditional extraction and partition of data attribute dimension is so
   manual and inefficiency as to not meet the needs of analysing big data.
   This paper proposed an attribute dimension partition scheme based on SVM
   classifying and MapReduce for analysing big data. This scheme improve
   traditional SVM classifying method by combining Euclidean distance
   theory for overcoming its disadvantages, and adopts punish coefficient
   to reduce the unbalance of data distribution. With the improved SVM
   classifying method, the implementation of attribute dimension partition
   take MapReduce model of Hadoop as process engine, use TF-IDF vector to
   save the extracted attribute dimension, and use k-means clustering
   algorithm to clustering partition. The experiment result shows that the
   execution efficiency of the proposed method is enhanced, and while the
   rationality of partition is guaranteed, the increasing of data
   attributes does not significantly increase the execution time.},

Title = {A Graph Partition-Based Large-Scale Distribution Network Reconfiguration
   Method},
Journal = {COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Month = {MAR 14},
Abstract = {This article focuses on the analysis of large-scale distribution network
   reconstruction fused with graph theory and graph partitioning
   algorithms. Graph theory and graph segmentation algorithms have been
   rushed by many researchers in the fields of medicine, drone, and neural
   network. It is a newcomer in the field of computer vision, which can not
   only realize the division in color but also divide it by image data. The
   distribution network is also indispensable for new energy, electric
   machines, but the traditional distribution network has many problems,
   such as not suitable for distributed power access and excessive network
   loss. To improve the performance of distribution networks and reduce
   network losses, this paper A multi-division model for distribution
   network construction and reconstruction is established, and a graph
   theory-based division algorithm method is proposed to effectively solve
   the problem of feeder-to-feeder reconstruction during large-scale
   distribution in distribution networks. Through its superconductivity
   phenomenon and the characteristics of clustering algorithm division,
   this paper uses formulas to show its division principle and gives
   examples of various distribution network reconstruction algorithms to
   explore which method of improvement can improve the performance of the
   distribution network and reduce network losses. The number of iterations
   is also strictly considered, and the value is taken after multiple
   iterations to reduce the error. Through the distribution network
   calculation example, the network loss reduction value is obtained, and
   the distribution network fault repair model is exemplified. The picture
   is used to briefly describe the process of distribution network
   reconstruction and find that the faults of the distribution network can
   be quickly located and isolated through the FTU, and quickly repaired.
   Finally, in order to reduce the network loss, reduce the load of power
   flow calculation, and solve the problem of local optimization, a
   JA-BE-JA optimization algorithm based on large-scale distribution
   network reconfiguration is proposed. The mixed sampling method is
   preferred to test the number of divisions in the four states, and the
   parameters are selected to test the performance of the improved
   annealing simulation algorithm, and the conclusion is drawn as follows:
   the improved graph segmentation algorithm has strong robustness, can
   avoid local optimization of graph data, and can reduce network loss.
   Compared with traditional distribution network reconstruction methods,
   the network loss can be reduced to 454.3 KW, which can be optimized by
   10.68\% compared with the initial network loss.},

Abstract = {Drugs Interaction (https://covid19-druginteractions.org/) is a website

   any interaction between the chosen drugs. Beyond the interaction,
   however, the website does not advise if the resulting class of
   co-medication is safe to use or otherwise along with one of the nine
   COVID drugs. Therefore, there exist a need to use an unsupervised
   clustering approach to group the COVID drugs and respective
   co-medications that are safe to use in the absence of interaction and
   vice versa. This paper focused on application of the Partitioning Around

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Partition-based clustering methods, such as point center-based and plane
   center-based clustering techniques, have drawn much attention due to
   their simplicity and effectiveness in general clustering tasks. However,
   most of these methods use an unbounded distance during clustering, which
   may cause their performance to be sensitive to the defined infinite
   measure, and almost all of them cannot automatically identify halos. To
   solve these prob-lems, by adopting a locally finite capped l2;1-norm
   distance in clustering, this paper pro-poses a novel clustering method
   named locally finite distance clustering with discriminative information
   (LFDC). The LFDC effectively solves the above problems and realizes
   robust clustering by solving a series of eigenvalue problems. We test
   the effective-ness of the LFDC on a number of different data, including
   artificial data, benchmark data, and image segmentation data. The
   experimental results show that the LFDC is more robust than the compared
   methods.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

   similar sensing patterns, detecting outliers, and segmenting large
   behavioral groups in real-time. Traditional full batch k-means for
   clustering loT big data is confronted by large scaled storage and high
   computational complexity problems. In order to overcome the latency
   inherited from full batch k-means, two big data processing methods were
   often used: the first method is to use small batches as the input data
   to multiple computers for reducing the computation efforts. However,
   depending on the sensed data which may be heterogeneously fused from
   different sources in an IoT network, the size of each mini batch may
   vary in each iteration of clustering process. When these input data are
   subject to clustering their centers would shift drastically, which
   affects the final clustering results. The second method is parallel
   computing, it decreases the runtime while the overall computational
   effort remains the same. Furthermore, some centroid based clustering
   algorithm such as k-means converges easily into local optima. In light
   of this, in this paper, a new partitioned clustering method that is
   optimized by metaheuristic is proposed for IoT big data environment. The
   method has three main activities: Firstly, a sample of the dataset is
   partitioned into mini batches. It is followed by adjusting the centroids
   of the mini batches of data. The third step is collating the mini
   batches to form clusters, so the quality of the clusters would be
   maximized. How the positions of the centroids could be optimally attuned
   at the mini batches are governed by a metaheuristic called Dynamic Group
   Optimization. The data are processed in parallel in Hadoop. Extensive
   experiments are conducted to investigate the performance. The results
   show that our proposed method is a promising tool for clustering fused
   loT data efficiently. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Water Network Partitioning (WNP) improves water network management,
   simplifying the computation of water budgets and, consequently, allowing
   the identification and reduction of water loss. It is achieved by
   inserting flow meters and gate valves in the network, previously
   clustered in subsystems. The clustering and partitioning phases are
   carried out with different procedures. The first one requires clustering
   algorithms that assign network nodes to each district (or cluster). The
   second one chooses the boundary pipes where flow meters or gate valves
   are to be inserted. In this paper, SWANP software is employed to achieve
   a network clustering through two different algorithms based on a
   multilevel-recursive bisection and community -structure procedures.
   After that, a novel multi-objective function is introduced and applied
   to a large Mexican network integrating both cost and energy performance,
   thus providing a smart Decision Support System (DSS) based on
   qualitative and quantitative measures, and diagrams for evaluating the
   optimal layout in terms of the number of districts, cost, and hydraulic
   performance. (C)2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Abstract = {The recent extension of a macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD) into a
   bi-modal MFD (or 3D-MFD) provides the relationship among the total
   network circulating flows and the accumulations of private vehicles and
   public buses. 3D-MFD reveals the contribution of large occupancy
   vehicles such as buses in improving urban transportation efficiency. A
   lot of bi-modal traffic management techniques are introduced based on
   3D-MFD to improve the urban traffic efficiency without using detailed
   origin-destination (OD) information. However, similar to MFD, 3D-MFD is
   also highly affected by the heterogeneity of a road network. In order to
   form 3D-MFDs with low scatter to be utilized for further bi-modal
   traffic management, this paper proposes a partition method to cluster
   road links into several homogeneous regions for a bi-modal urban
   network. It is comprised of three layers named as initial partition,
   merging, and boundary adjusting. At the initial partition layer, Seeded
   Region Growing (SRG) and the Technique for Order Preference by
   Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) are integrated to obtain a number
   of subregions. A modified Genetic Algorithm (GA) is developed to merge
   the subregions into larger regions at the merging layer. Then, boundary
   adjusting is performed by changing the region to which a boundary is
   clustered to optimize the result. Multi-sensor data collected from
   Shenzhen in China are utilized to verify the effectiveness of the
   proposed partition method.},

Abstract = {The size and complexity of large power systems, such as the European
   one, often make them unmanageable for the purposes of Transmission
   Expansion Planning (TEP). Therefore, network reduction methods are
   necessary to condense their key features into a workable model, which
   should approximate the behavior of the nodal system as accurately as
   possible. We define critical branches as the transmission lines that are
   particularly relevant for TEP purposes because of, for instance,
   frequent congestions or a special nature such as the cases of HVDC
   (High-Voltage Direct Current) transmission lines or PSTs (Phase-Shifting
   Transformers). It would be desirable to preserve these critical branches
   while simplifying the remaining grid. We propose a heuristic algorithm
   that creates an initial partition that is later refined by clustering
   nodes based on a composite distance measure. The proposed technique has
   been applied to a real case study based on the French and Spanish
   systems.},

Title = {Random Partition Based Adaptive Distributed Kernelized SVM for Big Data},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Pages = {95623-95637},
Abstract = {In this paper, we present a distributed classification technique for big
   data by efficiently using distributed storage architecture and data
   processing units of a cluster. While handling such large data, the
   existing approaches consider specific data partitioning techniques which
   demand complete data be processed before partitioning. This leads to an
   excessive overhead of high computation and data communication. The
   proposed method does not require any pre-structured data partitioning
   technique and is also adaptive to big data mining tools. We hypothesize
   that an effective aggregation of the information generated from data
   partitions by subprocesses of the complete learning process can lead to
   accurate prediction results while reducing the overall time complexity.
   We build three SVM based classifiers, namely one phase voting SVM
   (1PVSVM), two phase voting SVM (2PVSVM), and similarity based SVM
   (SIMSVM). Each of these classifiers utilizes the support vectors as the
   local information to construct the synthesized learner for efficiently
   reducing the training time and ensuring minimal communication between
   processing units. In this context, an extensive empirical analysis
   demonstrates the effectiveness of our classifiers when compared to other
   existing approaches on several benchmark datasets. However, among
   existing methods and three of our proposed (1PVSVM, 2PVSIM, and SIMSVM)
   methods, SIMSVM is the most efficient. Considering MNIST dataset, SIMSVM
   achieves an average speedup ratio of 0.78 and minimum scalability of
   73\% when the data size is scaled up to 10 times. It also retains high
   accuracy (99\%) similar to centralized approaches.},

Title = {Water Distribution Network Partitioning Based on Complex Network Theory:
   The Udine Case Study},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {8},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Water Distribution Network Partitioning (WDNP), which is the
   partitioning of the existing Water distribution Network (WDN) into
   smaller and more homogeneous portions called District Metered Areas
   (DMAs), is an effective strategy that allows water utilities to improve
   network management through water balance, pressure control, water loss
   detection, and protection from contamination. The partitioning is
   realized physically, closing the pipes between two different districts,
   or virtually, installing flow meters which measure the districts inflow
   and outflow. Pipe closures lead to a considerable network performance
   worsening, reducing minimum pressure, resilience, and redundancy; on the
   other hand, flow meters allow us to avoid these issues but involve a
   higher investing cost. Hence, the DMAs' definition could become a hard
   task because both network performance and maximum investing cost must be
   respected. This paper presents the application of an optimization
   approach, based on complex network theory, coupled with an optimization
   technique based on genetic algorithms (GA). The methodology, implemented
   in Python environment, consists of a clustering phase carried out with
   two different algorithms (Girvan-Newman and spectral clustering) and a
   dividing phase which defines whether a gate valve or a flow meter should
   be installed in a pipe. The last phase is fulfilled with the GA which
   allows us to optimize one or more objectives in order to minimize the
   cost and maximize the network performance. The methodology has been
   applied on the Udine water distribution system, whose hydraulic model
   has been calibrated with a recent measure campaign. The results produced
   with the different clustering algorithms and objective functions have
   been compared to show their pros and cons.},

Abstract = {As the penetration level of distributed photovoltaic (PV) systems keeps
   increasing in distribution networks, overvoltage due to reverse power
   flow is an urgent issue to be addressed. This paper proposes a voltage
   regulation method by utilizing the voltage control capability of PV
   inverters. A novel network partition approach based on a community
   detection algorithm is presented to realize zonal voltage control in a
   shorter control response time using the minimum amount of reactive power
   compensation and active power curtailment. An improved modularity index
   that considers local reactive power balance is introduced to partition a
   distribution network into several clusters/communities with PVs based on
   the node voltage sensitivity analysis. An optimal reactive and active
   power control strategy is proposed for voltage control in each cluster.
   The voltage management of the overall system can he achieved by
   controlling each cluster separately. The proposed approach is applied to
   the voltage control of a practical 10 kV, 37-node feeder. Case studies
   on the real distribution network and a modified IEEE 123-node system are
   carried out to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed

Title = {SpecMap: An efficient spectral partitioning based static application
   mapping algorithm for 2D mesh NoCs},
Journal = {CONCURRENCY AND COMPUTATION-PRACTICE \& EXPERIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUN 17},
Abstract = {Network-on-chip (NoC) is adopted as a flexible and effective
   communication backbone by multiprocessor systems with core counts
   ranging from a few to hundreds. The performance of NoC based systems
   greatly rely on the communication between cores when two dependent tasks
   of an application are mapped to these cores. Hence, application mapping
   becomes a critical issue in NoC-based systems as it affects the overall
   performance of the system. Application mapping aims to reduce the
   communication among the cores by carefully mapping the highly
   communicating tasks. Most of the existing static mapping approaches
   consider only single-task platforms. In this article, we propose an
   efficient multi-task static mapping algorithm called SpecMap\$\$ SpecMap
   \$\$, for regular 2D NoC systems. SpecMap\$\$ SpecMap \$\$ consists of
   three stages namely, (i) graph partitioning, (ii) topology clustering,
   and (iii) mapping. In the graph partitioning stage, SpecMap\$\$ SpecMap
   \$\$ accurately identifies and groups the highly communicating tasks
   based on spectral graph partitioning. Then, the clustering and mapping
   stages allocate the most communicating tasks in the same or adjacent
   multi-tasking cores. It also eliminates the interference between
   multiple applications by mapping them into different clusters of the NoC
   network. Simulations of SpecMap\$\$ SpecMap \$\$ have been conducted on
   different synthetic and real-life applications using Gem5 simulator. The
   simulation results show considerable improvements for SpecMap in terms
   of communication cost, average network latency, energy consumption,
   throughput, and execution time as compared to the state-of-the-art
   algorithms.},

Abstract = {In data clustering, partition based clustering algorithms are widely
   used clustering algorithms. Among various partition algorithms, fuzzy
   algorithms, Fuzzy c-Means (FCM), Gustafson-Kessel (GK) and non-fuzzy
   algorithm, k-means (KM) are most popular methods. k-means and Fuzzy
   c-Means use standard Euclidian distance measure and Gustafson-Kessel
   uses fuzzy covariance matrix in their distance metrics. In this work, a
   comparative study of these algorithms with different famous real world
   data sets, liver disorder and wine from the UCI repository is presented.
   The performance of the three algorithms is analyzed based on the
   clustering output criteria. The results were compared with the results
   obtained from the repository. The results showed that Gustafson-Kessel
   produces close results to Fuzzy c-Means. Further, the experimental
   results demonstrate that k-means outperforms the Fuzzy c-Means and
   Gustafson-Kessel algorithms. Thus the efficiency of k-means is better
   than that of Fuzzy c-Means and Gustafson-Kessel algorithms. (C) 2015

Title = {A Bipartite Graph Partition-Based Coclustering Approach With Graph
   Nonnegative Matrix Factorization for Large Hyperspectral Images},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {60},
Abstract = {Clustering large hyperspectral images (HSIs) is a very challenging
   problem because large HSIs have high dimensionality, large spectral
   variability, and large computational and memory consumption. Recently,
   sparse subspace clustering (SSC) has achieved remarkable success in HSI
   clustering. However, most SSC-based methods suffer from the following
   bottlenecks for large HSIs: 1) high computational consumption and memory
   space during the construction of the similarity matrix and decomposition
   of the graph Laplacian matrix and 2) failure to capture the
   relationships among dictionary atoms, sparse coefficients, and
   hyperspectral pixels. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
   algorithm that extends SSC to cocluster large HSIs, called bipartite
   graph partition with graph nonnegative matrix factorization (BGP-GNMF).
   Specifically, to fully explore the characteristics of the spectral and
   spatial contexts in HSIs, we propose a novel superpixel and pixel
   coclustering framework with bipartite graph partitioning in the joint
   sparse representation domain, where superpixel-based dictionary atoms
   are defined as disjoint vertex sets of the bipartite graph and the joint
   sparsity representation is mapped into the adjacency matrix of the
   undirected bipartite graph. To overcome the challenges of high
   computational consumption and large memory space for large HSIs, the
   bipartite graph partition with orthonormal constrained nonnegative
   matrix factorization is proposed to simultaneously cluster the
   structured dictionary atoms and hyperspectral pixels with an indicator
   matrix. Finally, to exploit the intrinsic geometry of HSIs, we
   incorporate manifold regularization into the bipartite graph partition
   to improve final clustering accuracy. The effectiveness and efficiency
   of the proposed method are verified on three classical HSIs, and the
   experimental results illustrate the superiority of the proposed method
   compared with other state-of-the-art HSI clustering methods.},

Abstract = {This article presents a novel method for fuzzy space partitioning and
   the identification of Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy models. The novelty is in its
   region-splitting mechanism and membership function definition, which is
   based on hyperplanes. The proposed algorithm introduces a concept of
   principal component analysis to define the hyperplanes that split the
   problem space and uses the distances to these hyperplanes as metrics
   instead of center-oriented clusters. In contrast with many other
   methods, the presented method delivers reproducible results and has an
   easy tuning procedure. The performance is illustrated with analytical
   examples, benchmark problems from the literature, and real-process data.
   The obtained results are very promising; however, as with most learning
   methods, the results depend on the data distribution and input variable

Abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of partitioning the vertex set of an
   edge-weighted undirected graph into two parts of specified sizes so as
   to minimize the sum of the weights on edges joining vertices in
   different parts. This problem is NP-hard and has several important
   applications in which the graph size is typically large and the
   brute-force approach (of listing all feasible partitions and comparing
   costs) is computationally prohibitive. In this paper a new class of
   algorithms is developed on the basis of a transformation of the graph
   problem to a geometric problem of clustering a set of points in
   Euclidean space. Instead of searching through all feasible partitions
   that meet the size specifications, it is shown that the search can be
   confined to a set of n(p(p+1)/2) partitions, where n is the number of
   vertices in the graph and p is the rank of the n x n graph connection
   matrix. Procedures are developed for constructing all such partitions in
   O(n(p(p+3)/2)) time. For matrices with large ranks, approximation of the
   connection matrix by a matrix of low rank by using principal-components
   analysis is suggested. The algorithms presented in this paper are
   constructive algorithms in that they generate a feasible partition of
   the graph directly from the connection matrix, as opposed to iterative
   algorithms that start from a feasible partition as an initial guess. The
   algorithms also bound the difference between the achieved cost and the
   lowest achievable cost. These lower bounds on the cost of the optimal
   partition are proved to be superior to the Donath-Hoffman lower bound
   for two significant special cases wherein either the two part sizes are
   equal or the graph connection matrix has equal row sums. Simulation
   results on randomly constructed graphs of different sizes clearly
   demonstrate the effectiveness of these heuristics in terms of both the
   cost of the constructed partition and the lower bound provided.},

Title = {Early Termination of CU Partition Based on Boosting Neural Network for
   3D-HEVC Inter-Coding},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Pages = {13870-13883},
Abstract = {As an extension of the High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) standard, the
   3D-HEVC needs to encode multiple texture videos and depth maps
   components. In the 3D-HEVC inter-coding test model, a large variety of
   Coding Unit (CU) sizes are adopted to select the one with the lowest
   Rate-Distortion (RD) cost as the best CU size. This technique provides
   the highest achievable coding efficiency, but it brings a huge
   computational complexity which limits 3D-HEVC from practical
   applications. In this paper, early termination of CU encoding is
   proposed to reduce the complexity caused by the CU size splitting
   process. The proposed algorithm is based on CU homogeneity and a
   boosting neural network clustering algorithm. The algorithm contained
   three main steps. The first step is for the extraction of various
   features from the original encoder. Then, the selection of the features,
   which had a high correlation with CU partition using a machine learning
   algorithm. In the second step, a boosting neural network model is used
   for training the selected features to derive the threshold values for
   our proposed algorithm. In the final step, an efficient early
   termination of CU splitting is released for texture videos and depth
   maps based on the extracted thresholds from the training model. The
   experimental results show that the proposed algorithm reduces a
   significant encoding time, while the loss in coding efficiency is
   negligible.},

Abstract = {One of the important issues regarding the implementation of cellular
   manufacturing relates to deciding whether to convert an existing job
   shop into a cellular manufacturing system comprehensively in a single
   go, or to convert in stages incrementally wherein the cells are formed
   one after the other taking the advantage of experiences of
   implementation. In this paper, a heuristic method based on iterative set
   partitioning is proposed for incremental cell formation where part
   operations can be processed on alternative machines. The objective is to
   minimize cycle time for a given number of workstations. The proposed
   method is numerically compared with the existing branch and bound
   technique and another heuristic algorithm based on multistage
   programming. It is found that the proposed method requires significantly
   less computational efforts to yield the optimal solution.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER INTEGRATED MANUFACTURING},

Volume = {28},
Number = {10},
Pages = {1077-1091},

Abstract = {Set-up planning is an important step in manufacturing a part type, and
   it can be used to integrate the manufacturing functions of process
   planning and scheduling. While considering the problem from optimisation
   perspective, set-up planning involves several issues such as grouping
   the features, tool approach direction (TAD) and machining operations.
   Here, we have considered the minimisation of total manufacturing cost,
   makespan and maximisation of the machine utilisation to obtain an
   optimal set-up plan while satisfying all the constraints. The
   cross-machine adaptive set-up planning (ASP) for a part is a nested
   partition (NP)-hard problem with flexible machining resources. Also, its
   impact on the integration of process planning and scheduling is a
   crucial step. The NP-based approach, which partitions the solution
   space, selecting the most promising region according to the formulated
   objective function, is adapted and reported in this article. This
   approach clusters the computational effort in the most promising region
   and also generates an exact optimal solution for underlying various
   set-up planning. The proposed algorithm has been tested by taking an
   illustrative example, and the results are compared with genetic
   algorithm. Further, five diverse scenarios are studied to prove the
   efficiency of the proposed approach.},

Abstract = {Traditional clustering techniques alone cannot resolve all challenges of
   partition-based clustering methods. In the partition based clustering,
   particularly in variants of K-means, initial cluster centre selection is
   a significant and crucial point. The dependency of final cluster is
   totally based on initial cluster centres; hence, this process is
   delineated to be most significant in the entire clustering operation.
   The random selection of initial cluster centres is unstable, since
   different cluster centre points are achieved during each run of the
   algorithm. Ensemble based clustering methods resolve challenges of
   partition-based methods. The clustering ensembles join several
   partitions generated by different clustering algorithms into a single
   clustering solution. The proposed ensemble methodology resolves initial
   centroid problems and improves the efficiency of cluster results. This
   method finds centroid selection through overall mean distance measure.
   The SimRank based similarity matrix find that the bipartite graph helps
   to ensemble.},

Abstract = {Data mining is the process of extracting hidden, interesting,
   non-trivial, potentially useful and previously unknown information from
   large databases. Clustering is one of the data mining techniques that
   aims to separate dissimilar objects and group similar objects in the
   database. There are a number of clustering methods available in
   literature. In this paper, authors have focused on partitioning based
   methods. Most popular partitioning based algorithms, k-means and
   k-medoid, require the number of clusters to be generated as an input
   parameter. Another partitioning based algorithm, Single Pass Clustering
   (SPC), requires a threshold similarity value as an input parameter for
   clustering. In this paper, a modified SPC algorithm is proposed which
   also uses threshold similarity value but it is not an input parameter,
   rather, it is a function of data objects to be clustered. To assess
   performance of proposed approach, several clustering validity measures
   have been applied on k-means, SPC and the modified SPC algorithms. The
   stimulated experiments described in this paper confirm good performance
   of the modified SPC. It is also observed that actual number of clusters
   is generated when modified SPC is applied on real datasets.},

Abstract = {Partitioning-based clustering methods have various challenges especially
   user-defined parameters and sensitivity to initial seed selections.
   K-means is most popular partitioning based method while it is sensitive
   to outlier, generate non-overlap cluster and non-deterministic in nature
   due to its sensitivity to initial seed selection. These limitations are
   regarded as promising research directions. In this study, a
   deterministic approach which do not requires user defined parameters
   during clustering; can generate overlapped and non-overlapped clusters
   and detect outliers has been proposed. Here, a minimum support value has
   been adopted from association rule mining to improve the clustering
   results. Further, the improved approach has been analysed on artificial
   and real datasets. The results demonstrated that datasets are well
   clustered with this approach too and it achieved success to generate
   almost same number of clusters as present in real datasets.},

Abstract = {Recently a data mining particularly a stream data has been drawing
   widespread attentions of the researchers and the experts around the
   globe and a huge number of interesting research outcomes have been
   achieved. The scope of data generation and analytics has increased
   exponentially due to increase in the data transfer rate, integration and
   connection of the digitalized systems. Today most of the device
   generates data which are huge in volume, non-stationary and fast
   changing. As the data available is huge in size there is requirement of
   clustering in order to enhance the quality of data that will provide
   desired outcome. Clustering is the procedure of making a group of
   abstract objects into classes of similar objects. Clustering will
   increase data processing speed which is most important in data mining.
   So clustering has become challenging field of research because of their
   special requirements of its applications. In data stream mining the
   clustering possess very important role. Stream data are the types of
   data sets which are massive, complex, fast changing and potentially
   infinite We cannot gather each clement of a stream since stream flows so
   quick and changes so rapidly. Sometimes there is requirement of many
   applications to group the data based on its characteristics so
   clustering is done on such types of data. In this paper we have reviewed
   typical requirements of clustering in data mining, major challenges and
   issues of the clustering methods, different techniques of clustering for
   data mining with basic algorithm of each of these methods with their
   advantages and disadvantages and methods used for stream data.},

Abstract = {Selective clustering ensemble is usually based on the reference
   partition to select members of the ensemble. General method of
   generating reference partition is to use preliminary ensemble results,
   yet it cannot eliminate the influence of the inferior clustering
   partitions and the final clustering result is not satisfactory. In order
   to solve this problem, the paper proposes a new selective clustering

   the best reference partition based on clustering validity evaluation;(2)
   putting forward the new selection strategy and the method of member's

Abstract = {Due to increasing databases of all kinds, clustering has become one of
   the most essential tasks to classify the data. Clustering means to group
   or divide the data points based on their similarity to each other.
   Clustering can be stated as an unsupervised data mining technique that
   describes the nature of datasets. The main objective of data clustering
   is to obtain groups of similar entities. There are various methods of
   clustering such as hierarchical, partition-based, method-based,
   grid-based, and model-based. This paper provides a detailed study about
   clustering, its working processes. Along with basic information,
   detailed information about validity measures required to evaluate
   algorithms is discussed. This paper reviews clustering algorithms like
   K-Means, Agglomerative, and DBSCAN. A tabular comparison of algorithms
   is represented to acquire in-depth knowledge. The results obtained after
   experimenting with algorithms are also been discussed at the end.},

Abstract = {Background: A well-known problem in cluster analysis is finding an
   optimal number of clusters reflecting the inherent structure of the
   data. PFClust is a partitioning-based clustering algorithm capable,
   unlike many widely-used clustering algorithms, of automatically
   proposing an optimal number of clusters for the data.
   Results: The results of tests on various types of data showed that
   PFClust can discover clusters of arbitrary shapes, sizes and densities.
   The previous implementation of the algorithm had already been
   successfully used to cluster large macromolecular structures and small
   druglike compounds. We have greatly improved the algorithm by a more
   efficient implementation, which enables PFClust to process large data
   sets acceptably fast.
   Conclusions: In this paper we present a new optimized implementation of
   the PFClust algorithm that runs considerably faster than the original.},

Abstract = {Fast and high quality document clustering is a crucial task in
   organizing information, search engine results, enhancing web crawling,
   and information retrieval or filtering. Recent studies have shown that
   the most commonly used partition-based clustering algorithm, the K-means
   algorithm, is more suitable for large datasets. However, the K-means
   algorithm can generate a local optimal solution. In this paper we
   propose a novel Harmony K-means Algorithm (HKA) that deals with document
   clustering based on Harmony Search (HS) optimization method. It is
   proved by means of finite Markov chain theory that the HKA converges to
   the global optimum. To demonstrate the effectiveness and speed of HKA,
   we have applied HKA algorithms on some standard datasets. We also
   compare the HKA with other meta-heuristic and model-based document
   clustering approaches. Experimental results reveal that the HKA
   algorithm converges to the best known optimum faster than other methods
   and the quality of clusters are comparable.},

   tries to improve the partitions progressively. Different initial
   partitions can result in different final clusters. Trying through all
   the possible candidate clusters for the perfect result is too time
   consuming. Metaheuristic algorithm aims to search for global optimum in
   high-dimensional problems. Meta-heuristic algorithm has been
   successfully implemented on data clustering problems seeking a near
   optimal solution in terms of quality of the resultant clusters. In this
   paper, a new metaheuristic search method called Elephant Search
   Algorithm (ESA) is proposed to integrate into K-means, forming a new
   data clustering algorithm, namely C-ESA. The advantage of ESA is its
   dual features of (i) evolutionary operations and (ii) balance of local
   intensification and global exploration. The results by C-ESA are
   compared with classical clustering algorithms including K-means, DBSCAN,
   and GMM-EM. C-ESA is shown to outperform the other algorithms in terms
   of clustering accuracy via a computer simulation.},

Journal = {ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {95},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This paper provides a short overview of space-time series clustering,
   which can be generally grouped into three main categories such as:
   hierarchical, partitioning-based, and overlapping clustering. The first
   hierarchical category is to identify hierarchies in space-time series
   data. The second partitioning-based category focuses on determining
   disjoint partitions among the space-time series data, whereas the third
   overlapping category explores fuzzy logic to determine the different
   correlations between the space-time series clusters. We also further
   describe solutions for each category in this paper. Furthermore, we show
   the applications of these solutions in an urban traffic data captured on
   two urban smart cities (e.g., Odense in Denmark and Beijing in China).
   The perspectives on open questions and research challenges are also
   mentioned and discussed that allow to obtain a better understanding of
   the intuition, limitations, and benefits for the various space-time
   series clustering methods. This work can thus provide the guidances to
   practitioners for selecting the most suitable methods for their used
   cases, domains, and applications.},

Abstract = {Membrane computing (known as P systems) is a novel class of distributed
   parallel computing models. In this paper, a partition-based clustering
   algorithm under the framework of membrane computing is proposed. The
   clustering algorithm is based on a tissue-like P system, which is used
   to exploit the optimal cluster centers for a data set. Each object in
   the tissue-like P system represents a group of candidate cluster centers
   and is evolved through simulated annealing mechanism and mutation
   mechanism. Meanwhile, communication rules are used to exchange and share
   the objects between different elementary membranes and between
   elementary membranes and the environment. The proposed clustering
   algorithm is evaluated over two artificial data sets and two real-life
   data sets and is further compared with k-means algorithm and GA-based
   k-means algorithm respectively. The comparison results reveal the
   superiority of the proposed clustering algorithm in terms of clustering
   quality and stability.},

Abstract = {In this digital world, we are facing the flood ofdata, but depriving for
   knowledge. The eminent need of mining isuseful to extract the hidden
   pattern from the wide availability of vastamount of data. Clustering is
   one such useful mining tool to handle this unfavorable situation by
   carrying out crucial steps refers ascluster analysis. It is the process
   of a grouping of patterns intoclusters based on similarity. Partition
   based clustering algorithms arewidely accepted for much diverse
   application such as patternanalysis, image segmentation, identification
   system. Among thedifferent variations of the partition based clustering,
   due to itsmonotony and ease of implementation K-means algorithm gained
   alot of attraction in the various field of research. A severe
   problemassociated with the algorithm is that it is highly sophisticated
   whileselecting the initial centroid and may converge to a local
   optimumsolution of the criterion function value if the initial centroid
   is notchosen accurately. Additionally, it requires the prior
   informationregarding a number of clusters to be formed and the
   computation ofK-means are expensive. K-means algorithm is a two-step
   process
   includes initialization and assignment step. This paper works
   oninitialization step of the algorithm and proposed an efficientenhanced
   K-means clustering algorithm which eliminates thedeficiency of the
   existing one. A new initialization approach has beenintroduced in the
   paper to drawn an initial cluster centers for Kmeans Algorithm. The
   paper also compares proposed technique withK-means technique},

Abstract = {The partitioning-based k-means clustering is one of the most important
   clustering algorithms. However, in big data environment, it faces the
   problems of random selection of initial cluster centers randomly,
   expensive communication overhead among MapReduce nodes and data skewing
   in data partitions, and others. To solve these problems, this paper
   proposes a parallel clustering algorithm based on grid density and local
   sensitive hash function (MR-PGDLSH) which takes into account the
   advantages of MapReduce and LSH (locality sensitive hash function). In
   the MR-PGDLSH, firstly the GDS (grid density strategy) is designed to
   obtain the relatively reasonable initial cluster centers. Then, a DP-LSH
   (data partition based on locality sensitive hash function) is proposed
   to divide the data set into multiple segments. The relevant data objects
   are mapped to the same sub-data set. The similarity function is designed
   to generate clusters, thereby reducing frequent communication overhead
   between nodes. Next, the AGS (adaptive grouping strategy) is applied to
   distribute the amount of data on each node evenly, which solves the
   problem of data skew on the node. Finally, the MR-PGDLSH is applied to
   mine the cluster centers in parallel, which obtains the final clustering
   results. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results have shown
   that the MR-PGDLSH is superior to the existing clustering algorithms.},

   generation problem in vector quantization. There are two different
   approaches to the problem: a codebook-based and a partition-based. From
   these, the codebook-based approach is clearly superior to the
   partition-based approach. The experiments show that a pure genetic
   algorithm does not give comparable results to the existing methods, but
   the inclusion of GLA iterations is vital. Even in this case, the
   time-distortion performance of the algorithm is still inferior to
   simulated annealing. In the case of binary images, the hybrid
   combination of GA and GLA gives the best results. The greatest
   deficiency of the algorithm is still its high running time.},

   partition-based methods produce the highest Silhouette Coefficient
   values and the better distribution amongst the clusters. The BIRCH
   algorithm also performs fairly well and can act as a good starting point
   to find cluster groups in new datasets as the algorithm does not

   adjusts the initial community partition based on the difference between

   the words appearing in them. Many of the clustering algorithms
   accessible through various text analytics tools are completely
   unsupervised in nature. That is, they are unable to incorporate any
   domain knowledge that might be available about the documents to improve
   the clustering accuracy and relevance. The authors present a graph
   partitioning based semi-supervised document clustering algorithm. The
   user provides knowledge about few of the documents in the form of
   ``must-link{''} and ``cannotlink{''} constraints between pairs of
   documents. A ``must-link{''} constraint between two documents expresses
   the fact that the user feels that the two corresponding documents must
   be clustered irrespective of their dissimilarity. Similarly, a
   ``cannot-link{''} signifies that the two documents should never be
   clustered together no matter how similar they might happen to be. These
   constraints are then incorporated into a graph partitioning based into a
   computationally efficient document clustering algorithm. Through
   experiments performed on publicly available text datasets, the proposed
   framework is validated.},

Abstract = {Because of the computation complexity of large circuits, the quadratic
   placement (Q-Place) cannot solve the placement problem fast enough
   without any preprocessing. In this paper, a method of combining the MFFC
   clustering and hMETIS partitioning based quadratic placement algorithm
   is proposed. Experimental results show it can gain good results but
   consume long running time. In order to cut down the running time, an
   improved MFFC clustering method (IMFFC) based Q-place algorithm is
   proposed in this paper. Comparing with the combining clustering and
   partitioning based method, it is much fast but with a little increase in

Title = {Swarm based automatic clustering using nature inspired Emperor Penguins
   Colony algorithm},
Journal = {EVOLVING SYSTEMS},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUN 11},
Abstract = {Nature acts as a source of concepts, mechanisms, and principles for
   designing artificial computing systems to deal with complex
   computational problems. Most heuristic and metaheuristic algorithms are
   taken from the behavior of biological systems or physical systems in
   nature. Clustering is the process of grouping a set of data and putting
   it in a class of similar examples. Since the clustering problem is an
   NP-hard problem, using metaheuristics can be an appropriate tool to deal
   with these issues. Indeed, clustering is a special case of an
   optimization problem. In classic clustering, knowing the number of
   clusters is required before clustering. This paper presents an algorithm
   that requires no prior knowledge to classify the data. In this paper, we
   proposed a swarm-based Emperor Penguins Colony (EPC) algorithm to solve
   both classic and automatic clustering problems. The proposed approach is
   compared with six state-of-the-art, popular, and improved
   nature-inspired algorithms, a partitioning-based heuristic algorithm,
   and a hierarchical clustering method on ten real-world datasets. The
   results show that classic and automatic clustering using the EPC
   algorithm has better performance in comparison with other competing
   algorithms.},

   proposed as well as implemented a new k-means-based clustering algorithm
   which forms clusters by detecting and removing both global and local
   outliers and automatically converging into optimal clusters which are
   formed by a two-part process of splitting the initial clusters into
   subclusters based on criterion at local level and, in the second part,
   merging the clusters that satisfy the nearness criterion. Experiments
   show that our algorithm is able to automatically generate optimal number
   of clusters of different sizes and shapes which are free from global and

Abstract = {Data clustering is one of the most popular branches of machine learning
   and data analysis. Partitioning-based type of clustering algorithms,
   such as K-means, is prone to the problem of producing a set of clusters
   that is far from perfect due to its probabilistic nature. The clustering
   process starts with some random partitions at the beginning, and then it
   attempts to improve the partitions progressively. Different initial
   partitions can result in different final clusters. Trying through all
   the possible candidate clusters for the perfect result is
   computationally expensive. Meta-heuristic algorithm aims to search for
   global optimum in high-dimensional problems. Meta-heuristic algorithm
   has been successfully implemented on data clustering problems seeking a
   near optimal solution in terms of quality of the resultant clusters. In
   this paper, a new meta-heuristic search method named elephant search
   algorithm (ESA) is proposed to integrate into K-means, forming a new
   data clustering algorithm, namely C-ESA. The advantage of C-ESA is its
   dual features of (i) evolutionary operations and (ii) balance of local
   intensification and global exploration. The results by C-ESA are
   compared with classical clustering algorithms including K-means, DBSCAN,
   and GMM-EM. C-ESA is shown to outperform the other algorithms in terms
   of clustering accuracy via a computer simulation. C-ESA is also
   implemented on time series clustering compared with classical algorithms
   K-means, Fuzzy C-means and classical meta-heuristic algorithm PSO. C-ESA
   outperforms the other algorithms in term of clustering accuracy. C-ESA
   is still comparable compared with state of art time series clustering
   algorithm K-shape.},

Abstract = {Hierarchical clustering has been successfully used in many applications,
   such as bioinformatics and social sciences. In this paper, we introduce
   Avalanche, a new top-down hierarchical clustering approach that takes a
   dissimilarity matrix as its input. Such a tool can be used for
   applications where the dataset is partitioned based on pairwise
   distances among the examples, such as taxonomy generation tools and
   molecular biology applications in which dissimilarity among gene
   sequences are used as inputs - as opposed to flat file attribute/value
   pair datasets. The proposed algorithm uses local as well as global
   information to recursively split data associated with a tree node into
   two sub-nodes until some predefined termination condition is met. To
   split a node, initially the example that is furthest away from the other
   examples - the anti-medoid - is assigned to right sub-node and then
   additional examples are progressively assigned to this node which are
   nearest neighbors of the previously added example as long as a given
   objective function improves. Experimental evaluations done with
   artificial and real world datasets show that the new approach has
   improved speed, and obtained comparable clustering results as the
   well-known UPGMA algorithm on all datasets used in the experiment.},

Abstract = {The recent advancement in information technologies makes autonomous cars
   in reality. The complexity of such cars increases day by day which
   results in high real-time computational demand. The existing multi-core
   real-time scheduling algorithms are based on partitioned and global
   scheduling approaches. The partitioned based algorithms having drawbacks
   like poor utilization bound, load balancing, not compatible with an open
   system environment and the global scheduling approach faces problems
   like high scheduling overhead. Cluster scheduling represents a hybrid
   scheduling approach that consists of a set of the processor as a cluster
   and tasks schedule to each processor of clusters using a global
   scheduling approach. The different task assignments heuristics are
   investigated for the homogeneous and heterogeneous cluster as well as a
   static and dynamic cluster that used the harmonic period aware
   technique. A new dynamic cluster-based hierarchical real-time scheduling
   algorithm for autonomous cars and compare the result with benchmarking

Abstract = {Clustering Spatio-temporal data is challenging because of the complexity
   of processing the spatial and temporal aspects. Various enhanced
   clustering approaches, such as partition-based and hierarchical-based
   algorithms have been proposed. However, the ST-DBSCAN density-based
   algorithm is commonly used to process irregularly shaped clusters.
   Moreover, ST- DBSCAN considers neighborhood parameters as spatial and
   non-spatial. The preliminary results from our experiments indicate that
   the ST-DBSCAN algorithm addresses temporal elements less effectively.
   Therefore, an improvement to the STDBSCAN algorithm was proposed by
   considering three neighborhood boundaries in neighborhood function. This
   experiment used the El Nino dataset from the UCI repository. The
   experimental results show that the proposed algorithm increased the
   performance indices by 27\% compared to existing approaches. Further
   improvement using the hierarchical Ward's method (with thresholds of 0.3
   and 0.1) reduced the number of clusters from 240 to 6 and increased
   performance indices by up to 73\%. It can be concluded that ST-HDBSCAN
   is a suitable clustering algorithm for Spatio-temporal data.},

   ST-DBSCAN considers neighborhood parameters as spatial and non-spatial.
   The preliminary results from our experiments indicate that the ST-DBSCAN
   algorithm addresses temporal elements less effectively. Therefore, an
   improvement to the ST-DBSCAN algorithm was proposed by considering three
   neighborhood boundaries in neighborhood function. This experiment used
   the El Nino dataset from the UCI repository. The experimental results
   show that the proposed algorithm increased the performance indices by
   27\% compared to existing approaches. Further improvement using the
   hierarchical Ward's method (with thresholds of 0.3 and 0.1) reduced the
   number of clusters from 240 to 6 and increased performance indices by up
   to 73\%. It can be concluded that ST-HDBSCAN is a suitable clustering
   algorithm for Spatio-temporal data.},

Abstract = {Clustering is the problem of partitioning a (large) set of data using
   unsupervised techniques. Today, there exist many clustering techniques.
   The most important characteristic of a clustering technique is the shape
   of the cluster it can find.
   In this paper, we propose a method that is capable to find arbitrary
   shaped clusters and uses simple geometric constructs, Circlusters.
   Circlusters are different radius sectored circles. Circlusters can be
   used to create many hybrid approaches in mixture with density based or
   partitioning based methods. We also proposed two new clustering methods
   that are capable to find complex clusters in O(n), where n is the size
   of the data set. Both of the methods are two phase. In the first phase,
   circlusters are mined to approximate the shape of the data set. In the
   second phase, connected circlusters are found to mine the final clusters
   using different approaches.},

Abstract = {Unsupervised learning is the process to partition the given data set
   into number of clusters where similar data objects belongs same cluster
   and dissimilar data objects belongs to another cluster, k-Means is the
   partition based unsupervised learning algorithm which is popular for its
   simplicity and ease of use. Yet, k-Means suffers from the major
   shortcoming of passing number of clusters and centroids in advance.
   Decimal scaling is one of the normalization approaches which standardize
   the features of the dataset and improve the effectiveness of the
   algorithm. Integrating different distance measures with modified k-Means
   algorithm help to select the proper distance measure for specific data
   mining application. This paper compare the results of modified k-Means
   with different distance measures like Euclidean Distance, Manhattan
   Distance, Minkowski Distance, Cosine Measure Distance and the Decimal
   Scaling normalization approach. Result Analysis is taken on various
   datasets from UCI machine dataset repository and shows that Mk-Means is
   advantageous and improve the effectiveness with normalized approach and

Abstract = {Recently, a variety of data acquisition methods leads to the description
   of the same thing from different angles, which induces a large number of
   multi-view data. Clustering multi-view data in large-scale data analysis
   is of great significance and very challenging. In this paper, we present
   a new robust clustering algorithm, the Multi-view Fuzzy K-means
   clustering (MFKC) algorithm. In MFKC, a fuzzy membership method is used
   and optimized to describe the probability of a sample belonging to
   certain clusters. Compared with the hard partition based multi-view
   clustering algorithms, MFKC can effectively describe the fuzzy
   relationship between multi-view data and all clusters, and has better
   interpretability for the clustering results. In addition, MFKC also sets
   different weights for different views. By optimizing the multi-view
   clustering objective function, we obtain the optimal weigh of each view
   to reflect the importance of the view. The feasibility and effectiveness
   of the proposed algorithm is validated through various experimental
   comparisons.},

Abstract = {The enormous increase of scientific papers in digital form has increased
   document management complexity. The development of effective and
   efficient methods to sort and organize the documents is thus very
   crucial. Clustering is one of data mining techniques widely applied in
   various field that may be used to resolve the issue. This paper presents
   the performance comparison of partitioning-based clustering algorithms,
   namely random clustering, k-means, x-means, and k-medoids in an
   unsupervised classification of scientific publications based on topic
   similarity. Rapidminer is utilized to preprocess and analyze the data.
   Afterwards, the purity value and processing time of each algorithm are
   investigated. The results show that k-means performs the best purity
   value, although its run time is not the fastest. Meanwhile random
   clustering offers the fastest processing time with the lowest purity
   value trade-off. None of the observed algorithms produce best purity and
   processing time at once. It may due to the complex of parameters that
   affect the clustering results, inter alia, the type of data, selected
   algorithm, distance measures, and preprocessing methods.},

Abstract = {Study of this paper describes the incremental behaviours of partitioning
   based K-means clustering. This incremental clustering is designed using
   the cluster's metadata captured from the K-Means results. Experimental
   studies shows that this clustering outperformed when the number of
   clusters increased, number of objects increased, length of the cluster
   radius decreased, while the incremental clustering outperformed when the
   number of new data objects are inserted into the existing database. In
   incremental approach, the K-means clustering algorithm is applied to a
   dynamic database where the data may be frequently updated. And this
   approach measure the new cluster centers by directly computes the new
   data from the means of the existing clusters instead of rerunning the
   K-means algorithm. Thus it describes, at what percent of delta change in
   the original database up to which incremental K-means clustering behaves
   better than actual K-means. It can be also used for large
   multidimensional dataset.},

Title = {Robust k-subspace discriminant clustering},
Journal = {APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {85},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {k-means, k-plane clustering (kPC) and q-flat are partition-based
   clustering methods that cluster samples around k centers, hyperplanes
   and affine subspaces, respectively. However, no discriminant or local
   information is considered. This paper proposes a robust k-subspace
   discriminant clustering (kSDC) method by introducing the discriminant
   and local information. kSDC constructs k subspaces with centers to
   proximate the samples in each subspace, and at the same time, maximizes
   the difference of the samples in between-cluster. By introducing the
   L1-norm discriminant and local information to each subspace, kSDC
   realizes robust dimensionality reduction and clustering, and its
   optimization problems can be solved through an effective alternating
   direction method of multipliers. Experimental results on benchmark data
   and image segmentation data show the effectiveness of our kSDC. (C) 2019

Abstract = {This paper presents a parallel varied density-based clustering algorithm
   with optimized data partition (PVDB). First, we improve the partition
   with reduced boundary points algorithm using shared nearest neighbour
   (SNN) methods and propose the reachable partition with reduced boundary
   points algorithm. Second, we introduce a layered grouping grid structure
   and propose an efficient k nearest neighbour (kNN) search method. This
   method enhances the efficiency of kNN searches and determines whether
   kNNs are in their own partitions. Third, we propose a new merging
   strategy for connecting clusters in different partitions, based on the
   reachable point concept. Meanwhile, the strategy avoids connecting
   clusters with varying densities by SNN as occurs with SNN-based
   clustering methods. Our algorithm is implemented and compared with
   DBSCAN-MR and GriDBSCAN using the MapReduce paradigm and shows better
   varied density clustering capability and scalability. In addition,
   varied applications show our algorithm's capability of discerning

Abstract = {The problem of frequent itemset mining is one of the more important
   problems in data mining which has been extensively employed across a
   wide range of other relevant tasks such as market basket analysis in
   marketing, or text analysis in text mining applications. The majority of
   the deterministic frequent itemset mining algorithms which have been
   proposed in recent years use some sort or another of an optimal data
   structures to reduce the overall execution time of the algorithm. In
   this paper, however, we have tried instead to introduce an approximation
   algorithm which works by converting the problem into a clustering
   problem where similar transactions are grouped together. Each cluster
   centroid represents an itemset which may be assumed to be a candidate
   frequent itemsets. The validity of this assumption is simply verified by
   calculating the support count of these itemsets. Those who meet the
   min-support condition are considered to be an actual frequent itemset.
   As for the remaining itemsets, they are then passed to MAFIA which
   extract all maximal frequent itemsets therefrom. Experimentations made
   on several well-known and diverse datasets show that the proposed
   algorithm performs almost always faster, and in some cases up to 10
   times faster, than the existing deterministic algorithms, and all this
   by retaining up to 95\% of its accuracy.},

Abstract = {Wireless content caching in small cell networks (SCNs) has recently been
   considered as an efficient way to reduce the data traffic and the energy
   consumption of the backhaul in emerging heterogeneous cellular networks.
   In this paper, we consider a cluster-centric SCN with combined design of
   cooperative caching and transmission policy. Small base stations (SBSs)
   are grouped into disjoint clusters, in which in-cluster cache space is
   utilized as an entity. We propose a combined caching scheme, where part
   of the cache space in each cluster is reserved for caching the most
   popular content in every SBS, while the remaining is used for
   cooperatively caching different partitions of the less popular content
   in different SBSs, as a means to increase local content diversity.
   Depending on the availability and placement of the requested content,
   coordinated multi-point technique with either joint transmission or
   parallel transmission is used to deliver content to the served user.
   Using Poisson point process for the SBS location distribution and a
   hexagonal grid model for the clusters, we provide analytical results on
   the successful content delivery probability of both transmission schemes
   for a user located at the cluster center. Our analysis shows an inherent
   tradeoff between transmission diversity and content diversity in our
   cooperation design. We also study the optimal cache space assignment for
   two objective functions: maximization of the cache service performance
   and the energy efficiency. Simulation results show that the proposed
   scheme achieves performance gain by leveraging cache-level and
   signal-level cooperation and adapting to the network environment and
   user quality-of-service requirements.},

Abstract = {An energy efficient routing algorithm is the major concern in wireless
   sensor network. Routing protocols can be categorized into four groups
   which are including quality of service (QoS) routing protocols,
   location-based routing protocols data-centric routing protocols and
   hierarchical -based routing protocols. For those applications in which
   the sensors are engaged in environment discovery, the hierarchical-based
   routing protocols are more efficient. In the other way, clustering
   techniques have been shown to be useful in both energy and scalability
   points of view. Hence, in this paper an energy aware routing algorithm
   based on clustering techniques is proposed. The proposed algorithm is
   suitable for the multi-hop large scale networks. Our main proposal is
   apply the network leveling techniques by which the efficiency of
   clustering based on HEED algorithm is improved. We compare our proposed
   algorithm with the known algorithms such as BMR and EELBCRP. In
   comparison with the existing algorithms, the simulation results of our
   proposed algorithm present the enhancement of the network lifetime
   significantly. Moreover, our proposed algorithm prevents the network
   from partitioning based on the energy consumption balance that it
   produces in the network.},

   famous algorithms in partition-based clustering algorithms, and has been

   the P system with the k-medoids algorithm, the maximum parallelism
   calculated by the P system can effectively reduce the time complexity of
   the k-medoids clustering algorithm. Based on this, this paper proposes a

Abstract = {K-Means is one of the most popular partition based clustering technique.
   K-means has gain popularity because of its simplicity and speed of
   classifying massive data rapidly and efficiently. However, the output of
   K-Means algorithm highly depends upon the selection of initial cluster
   centers because the initial cluster centers are chosen randomly. The
   other limitation of the algorithm is to input the required number of
   clusters. This requires some sort of intuitive knowledge about
   appropriate value of K which is sometimes difficult to predict as it
   requires domain knowledge. In this paper, we have proposed an algorithm
   based on the K-Means, but it does not require the number of clusters K
   as input. The time complexity and quality of the clusters produced by
   the proposed algorithm is compared with that of original K-Means using
   two different data sets.},

Abstract = {Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) based clustering algorithms have been
   employed successfully to detect clusters of heterogeneous nature. Given
   a dataset of n random points, most of the MST-based clustering
   algorithms first generate a complete graph G of the dataset and then
   construct MST from G. The first step of the algorithm is the major
   bottleneck which takes 0(n(2)) time. This paper proposes an algorithm
   namely MST-based clustering on partition-based nearest neighbor graph
   for reducing the computational overhead. By using a centroid based
   nearest neighbor rule, the proposed algorithm first generates a sparse
   Local Neighborhood Graph (LNG) and then the approximate MST is
   constructed from LNG. We prove that both size and computational time to
   construct the graph (LNG) is 0(n(3/2)), which is a 0(root n) factor
   improvement over the traditional algorithms. The approximate MST is
   constructed from LNG in 0(n(3/2) lg n) time, which is asymptotically
   faster than 0(n(2)). Experimental analysis on both synthetic and real
   datasets demonstrates that the computational time has been reduced
   significantly by maintaining the quality of clusters obtained from the
   approximate MST. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {In machine learning and data mining applications, clustering is a
   critical task for knowledge discovery that attract attentions from large
   quantities of researchers. Generally, with the help of label
   information, supervised learning methods have more flexible structure
   and better result than unsupervised learning. However, supervised
   learning is infeasible for clustering task. In this paper, to fill the
   gap between clustering and supervised learning, the proposed clustering
   methods introduce the exemplars discriminative information into a
   supervised learning. To build the effective objective function, a
   strategy for reducing intracluster distance and increasing intercluster
   distance is introduced to form a unified optimization objective
   function. With initially setting the clustering centers, the data that
   near the centers are selected as exemplars to indicate the ground truth
   of different classes. Discriminative learning is then introduced to
   learn the partition hyperplane and classify all the data into different
   classes. New clustering centers are calculated for selecting new
   exemplars alternately. Using the proposed algorithms, the unsupervised
   K-means clustering problem is effectively solved from the perceptive of
   optimization. Feature mapping is also introduced to improve the
   performance by reducing the intercluster distance. A novel framework for
   exploring discriminative information from unsupervised data is provided.
   The proposed algorithms outperform the state-of-the-art approaches on a
   wide range of benchmark datasets in terms of accuracy.},

Abstract = {Object matching has many potential applications in industry, defense and
   medical science. Most matching methods introduced in recent years are
   based on the invariant representations. Main invariants applied in
   computer vision are algebraic, differential invariants and integral
   invariants. Our approach in this paper uses an affine integral invariant
   within a Spiral Architecture. The invariant representation is based on
   the extracted object contour. The parameter to be used for
   parameterizing an object contour is derived from the enclosed area. The
   Spiral Architecture posseses powerful computation features that are
   pertinent to the vision process. We present a parallel algorithm for
   object recognition on clusters. Image partitioning based on Spiral
   Architecture provides well-balanced load and absolutely uniform
   sub-images. The cluster-based object recognition greatly increases
   computation speed.},

Title = {A fast and accurate algorithm for unsupervised clustering around
   centroids},
Journal = {INFORMATION SCIENCES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {400},
Pages = {63-90},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {A centroid-based clustering algorithm is proposed that works in a
   totally unsupervised fashion and is significantly faster and more
   accurate than existing algorithms. The algorithm, named CLUBS+ (for
   CLustering Using Binary Splitting), achieves these results by combining
   features of hierarchical and partition-based algorithms. Thus, CLUBS+
   consists of two major phases, i.e., a divisive phase and an
   agglomerative phase, each followed by a refinement phase. Each major
   phase consists of successive steps in which the samples are
   repartitioned using a criterion based on least quadratic distance. This
   criterion possesses unique analytical properties that are elucidated in
   the paper and exploited by the algorithm to achieve a very fast
   computation. The paper presents the results of the extensive experiments
   performed: these confirm that the new algorithm is fast, impervious to
   noise, and produces results of better quality than other algorithms,
   such as BOOL, BIRCH, and k-means(++), even when the analyst can
   determine the correct number of clusters-a very difficult task from
   which users are spared by CLUBS+. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {Finite mixture models are being increasingly used to provide model-based
   cluster analysis. To tackle the problem of block clustering which aims
   to organize the data into homogeneous blocks, recently we have proposed
   a block mixture model; we have considered this model under the
   classification maximum likelihood approach and we have developed a new
   algorithm for simultaneous partitioning based on the classification EM
   algorithm. From the estimation point of view, classification maximum
   likelihood approach yields inconsistent estimates of the parameters and
   in this paper we consider the block clustering problem under the maximum
   likelihood approach; unfortunately, the application of the classical EM
   algorithm for the block mixture model is not direct: difficulties arise
   due to the dependence structure in the model and approximations are
   required. Considering the block clustering problem under a fuzzy
   approach, we propose a fuzzy block clustering algorithm to approximate
   the EM algorithm. To illustrate our approach, we study the case of
   binary data by using a Bernoulli block mixture.},

Abstract = {Although attempts have been made to solve the problem of clustering
   categorical data via cluster ensembles, with the results being
   competitive to conventional algorithms, it is observed that these
   techniques unfortunately generate a final data partition based on
   incomplete information. The underlying ensemble-information matrix
   presents only cluster-data point relations, with many entries being left
   unknown. The paper presents an analysis that suggests this problem
   degrades the quality of the clustering result, and it presents a new
   link-based approach, which improves the conventional matrix by
   discovering unknown entries through similarity between clusters in an
   ensemble. In particular, an efficient link-based algorithm is proposed
   for the underlying similarity assessment. Afterward, to obtain the final
   clustering result, a graph partitioning technique is applied to a
   weighted bipartite graph that is formulated from the refined matrix.
   Experimental results on multiple real data sets suggest that the
   proposed link-based method almost always outperforms both conventional
   clustering algorithms for categorical data and well-known cluster

Abstract = {Single linkage (SLINK) hierarchical clustering algorithm is a preferred
   clustering algorithm over traditional partitioning-based clustering as
   it does not require the number of clusters as input. But, due to its
   high time complexity and inherent data dependencies, it does not scale
   well for large datasets. To the best of our knowledge, all existing
   parallel SLINK algorithms are based on the traditional SLINK algorithm
   and thus require large number of computing resources. In this paper, we
   present a novel optimization of SLINK algorithm, GridSLINK, which is an
   order of magnitude faster than the existing state-of-the-art
   implementation. The optimization in GridSLINK comes from reduction in
   number of distance calculations required by SLINK. This reduction is
   achieved by exploiting spatial locality of data points and using an
   adaptive gridding technique. GridSLINK is parallelized for distributed
   memory systems. Scalable performance is achieved for increasing number
   of compute nodes. The proposed parallel algorithm, dGridSLINK, is
   benchmarked against the best existing parallel algorithm in literature
   and found to outperform the latter for all the real datasets considered.
   dGridSLINK can cluster millions of data points in few seconds/minutes
   using a small number of processing elements, without compromising the
   quality of clustering.},

Title = {A mixed data clustering algorithm with noise-filtered distribution
   centroid and iterative weight adjustment strategy},
Journal = {INFORMATION SCIENCES},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Clustering is an important technology for data analysis. Cluster
   analysis for mixed data remains challenging. This paper proposes a mixed
   data clustering algorithm with noise filtered distribution centroid and
   iterative weight adjustment strategy. The proposed algorithm defines
   noise-filtered distribution centroid for categorical attributes. We
   combine both mean and noise-filtered distribution centroid to represent
   the cluster center with mixed attributes, the noise-filtered
   distribution centroid records the frequency of occurrences for each
   possible value of the categorical attributes in a cluster more
   accurately. Furthermore, because the ``noise values{''} are filtered,
   the measure to calculate the dissimilarity between data objects and
   cluster centers could be improved. In addition, the algorithm introduces
   an iterative weight adjustment strategy with combined intra-cluster and
   inter-cluster information. The unified weight measurement method is used
   for refining numeric attributes and categorical attributes. Then
   attributes with higher intra-cluster homogeneity and inter-clusters
   heterogeneity are considered as attributes with higher priority. They
   tend to be assigned with relatively heavier weights during clustering.
   Experimental results on different datasets from the UCI repository show
   that the MCFCIW algorithm outperforms the existing partition-based
   clustering algorithm and clustering algorithm based on data conversion
   for mixed data on both cluster validity indices and convergence speed.

Abstract = {Cluster analysis is the prominent data mining technique in knowledge
   discovery, and it discovers the hidden patterns from the data. The
   k-means, k-modes, and k-prototypes are partition-based clustering
   algorithms, and these algorithms select the initial centroids randomly.
   Because of its random selection of initial centroids, these algorithms
   provide the local optima in solutions. To solve these issues, the
   strategy of crow search algorithm is employed with these algorithms to
   obtain the global optimum solution. With the advances in information
   technology, the size of data increased in a drastic manner from
   terabytes to petabytes. To make proposed algorithms suitable to handle
   these voluminous data, the phenomena of parallel implementation of these
   clustering algorithms is used with Hadoop MapReduce framework. The
   proposed algorithms are experimented with large-scale data, and the
   results are compared in terms of cluster evaluation measures and

   performance of three mathematical formulations for the pricing

Title = {Efficient stochastic algorithms for document clustering},
Journal = {INFORMATION SCIENCES},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {220},
Pages = {269-291},
Month = {JAN 20},
Abstract = {Clustering has become an increasingly important and highly complicated
   research area for targeting useful and relevant information in modern
   application domains such as the World Wide Web. Recent studies have
   shown that the most commonly used partitioning-based clustering
   algorithm, the K-means algorithm, is more suitable for large datasets.
   However, the K-means algorithm may generate a local optimal clustering.
   In this paper, we present novel document clustering algorithms based on
   the Harmony Search (HS) optimization method. By modeling clustering as
   an optimization problem, we first propose a pure HS based clustering
   algorithm that finds near-optimal clusters within a reasonable time.
   Then, harmony clustering is integrated with the K-means algorithm in
   three ways to achieve better clustering by combining the explorative
   power of HS with the refining power of the K-means. Contrary to the
   localized searching property of K-means algorithm, the proposed
   algorithms perform a globalized search in the entire solution space.
   Additionally, the proposed algorithms improve K-means by making it less
   dependent on the initial parameters such as randomly chosen initial
   cluster centers, therefore, making it more stable. The behavior of the
   proposed algorithm is theoretically analyzed by modeling its population
   variance as a Markov chain. We also conduct an empirical study to
   determine the impacts of various parameters on the quality of clusters
   and convergence behavior of the algorithms. In the experiments, we apply
   the proposed algorithms along with K-means and a Genetic Algorithm (GA)
   based clustering algorithm on five different document datasets.
   Experimental results reveal that the proposed algorithms can find better
   clusters and the quality of clusters is comparable based on F-measure,
   Entropy, Purity, and Average Distance of Documents to the Cluster
   Centroid (ADDC). (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

   (RCB) of Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Cipher Logic Array (CGCRA), it's
   necessary to partition data flow graph (DFG) transformed from block

   based partitioning algorithm (DFCBP). The algorithm considers not only
   the number constraint of nodes but also the type constraint of nodes, to
   minimize the number of partition clusters and inter-cluster
   communication edges, node priority in ready list will be updated each
   partition based on priority function Node(priority). In addition,
   partition quality function Cost(cluster) is designed to evaluate
   performance of task partitioning algorithms. Experimental results show
   that, compared with existing clustering based partitioning (CBP) and
   level sensitive cluster based partitioning (LSCBP) algorithms, DFCBP can
   obtain the least number of partition clusters and inter-cluster
   communication overheads, about 4.6\% and 10.7\% average least reduction
   respectively, meanwhile, comprehensive partition quality is best, in

Title = {A Review of Convex Clustering From Multiple Perspectives: Models,
   Optimizations, Statistical Properties, Applications, and Connections},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUN 21},
Abstract = {Traditional partition-based clustering is very sensitive to the
   initialized centroids, which are easily stuck in the local minimum due
   to their nonconvex objectives. To this end, convex clustering is
   proposed by relaxing K-means clustering or hierarchical clustering. As
   an emerging and excellent clustering technology, convex clustering can
   solve the instability problems of partition-based clustering methods.
   Generally, convex clustering objective consists of the fidelity and the
   shrinkage terms. The fidelity term encourages the cluster centroids to
   estimate the observations and the shrinkage term shrinks the cluster
   centroids matrix so that their observations share the same cluster
   centroid in the same category. Regularized by the l(pn)-norm (p(n) ?
   \{1, 2, +8\}), the convex objective guarantees the global optimal
   solution of the cluster centroids. This survey conducts a comprehensive
   review of convex clustering. It starts with the convex clustering as
   well as its nonconvex variants and then concentrates on the optimization
   algorithms and the hyperpa-rameters setting. In particular, the
   statistical properties, the applications, and the connections of convex
   clustering with other methods are reviewed and discussed thoroughly for
   a better understanding the convex clustering. Finally, we briefly
   summarize the development of convex clustering and present some

Abstract = {Earth Observation (EO) data is a source of a wide range of information,
   in vegetation, oceanography, land use, land cover and many more
   applications. To uncover the hidden information in the data,
   unsupervised learning techniques like clustering is used popularly. With
   technological advancements, the amount of data received through
   satellites rises exponentially, possessing the properties of Big Data.
   Traditional implementations of clustering algorithms have processing
   limitations based on the memory capability of the system. In general,
   applying any clustering algorithm directly to the large EO raster data
   requires a considerably large amount of time, due to the spatio-temporal
   nature of the data. The data generated by remote sensors have
   significant redundant values, so we have made an attempt to use
   compressed raster data for clustering without decompressing it. In this
   work, we present the compact data structure, known as k(2)-raster, based
   technique for clustering raster data. k(2)-raster preserves the spatial
   context in the image and provides time efficient and lossless
   compression. We have applied this technique to OCM2-NDVI, in GeoTIFF
   format, single and stacked image to develop a compressed dataset for
   efficient representation. As partition based clustering algorithms are
   widely used in clustering EO data because of their simplicity and time
   efficiency, we have examined the results on k-means and mini-batch
   k-means. We have also assessed the performance of our algorithm on model
   based clustering algorithms. It has been demonstrated that, for datasets
   with larger numbers of raster values, the developed compact data
   structure based approach works very well in terms of compact
   representation of data as well as, with both the partition based and
   model based clustering techniques making the clustering scalable.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we propose a clustering based linear ordering algorithm
   which consists of global ordering and local ordering. In the global
   ordering, the algorithm forms clusters from n given vertices and orders
   the clusters. In the local ordering, the elements in each cluster are
   linearly ordered. The linear order, thus produced, is used to obtain
   optimal k-way partitioning based on scaled cost objective function. When
   the number of cluster is one, the proposed algorithm is exactly the same
   as MELO {[}2]. But the proposed algorithm has more global partitioning
   information than MELO by clustering. Experiment with 11 benchmark
   circuits for k-way (2 less than or equal to k less than or equal to 10)
   partitioning shows that the proposed algorithm yields an average of
   10.6\% improvement over MELO {[}2] for the k-way scaled cost
   partitioning.},

Title = {An ensemble hierarchical clustering algorithm based on merits at cluster
   and partition levels},
Journal = {PATTERN RECOGNITION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {136},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Ensemble clustering has emerged as a combination of several basic
   clustering algorithms to achieve high quality final clustering. However,
   this technique is challenging due to the complexities in primary
   clus-ters such as overlapping, vagueness, instability and uncertainty.
   Typically, ensemble clustering uses all the primary clusters into
   partitions for consensus, where the merits of a cluster or a partition
   can be con-sidered to improve the quality of the consensus. In general,
   the robustness of a partition may be poorly measured, while having some
   high-quality clusters. Inspired by the evaluation of cluster and
   partition, this paper proposes an ensemble hierarchical clustering
   algorithm based on the cluster consensus selec-tion approach. Here, the
   selection of a subset of primary clusters from partitions based on their
   merit level is emphasized. Merit level is defined using the development
   of Normalized Mutual Information measure. Clusters of basic clustering
   algorithms that satisfy the predefined threshold of this measure are
   selected to participate in the final consensus. In addition, the
   consensus of the selected primary clusters to create the final clusters
   is performed based on the clusters clustering technique. In this
   technique, the selected primary clusters are re-clustered to create
   hyper-clusters. Finally, the final clusters are formed by assigning
   instances to hyper-clusters with the highest similarity. Here, an
   innovative criterion based on merit and cluster size for defining
   similarity is presented. The performance of the proposed algorithm has
   been proven by extensive experiments on real-world datasets from the UCI
   repository compared to state-of-the-art algorithms such as CPDM, ENMI,
   IDEA, CFTLC and SSCEN.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Clustering is a popular data analysis technique to find the hidden
   relationship between patterns. It is an unsupervised technique which is
   applied to obtain the optimal cluster centres especially in
   partitioned-based clustering algorithms. Cat swarm optimisation (CSO) is
   a new meta-heuristic algorithm which has been applied to solve various
   optimisation problems and it provides better results in comparison to
   same class of algorithms. But, this algorithm suffers from diversity and
   local optima problems. This study presents a new hybrid CSO algorithm by
   incorporating Monte Carlo-based search equation and population centroid
   (PopC) operator with Gaussian probability distribution. Monte
   Carlo-based search equation is applied to enhance the diversity of the
   CSO algorithm. The population centroid (PopC) operator is used to
   prevent the CSO algorithm from trapping in local optima. The performance
   of the proposed algorithm is tested with several artificial and real
   datasets and compared with existing methods like K-means and PSO. The
   experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm is a robust
   and effective algorithm to handle the clustering problems.},

   been techniques to improve the accuracy of k-means clustering
   algorithms, many of them are applied independently. In this paper, we
   present a k-means clustering algorithm with Mahalanobis distance. This
   is a non-trivial integration of partitioning based clustering,

Abstract = {In this paper, we present a new Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR)

   the representation (metadata) of images' visual content. In order to
   produce such metadata, we propose an efficient and adaptive clustering
   algorithm to segment the images into regions of high-similarity. This
   approach contrasts with those that use a single color histogram for the
   whole image (global methods), or local color histograms for a fixed
   number of image cells (partition-based methods). Our experimental
   results show that our clustering approach offers high retrieval
   effectiveness with low space overhead. For example, using a database of
   20,000 images we obtained higher retrieval effectiveness than
   partition-based methods with about the same space overhead of global
   methods, which are typically regarded to as storage-wise compact.},

Title = {Clustering by hybrid K-Means and black hole entropic fuzzy clustering
   algorithm for medical data},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODELING SIMULATION AND SCIENTIFIC COMPUTING},

Month = {2022 APR 25},
Abstract = {Today clustering-based machine learning algorithms are the important
   field in data mining. Here, medical data clustering is one of the core
   applications of data mining to predict and identify the risk factor of
   the disease. At the same time, medical data clustering is a very
   important and challenging task due to its complexity and high frequency
   of data. In order to achieve proper data clustering, this paper proposed
   a hybrid data clustering algorithm by the combination of K-Means and
   Black Hole Entropic Fuzzy Clustering (BHEFC). K-Means is the first and
   one of the most popular and low-computation cost partitioned-based
   clustering algorithms. There are two modules in this hybrid clustering,
   first some number of iterations are executed by the first module of this
   hybrid clustering algorithm, which is K-Means clustering. After some
   number of iterations, the clustering solutions are shifted to the second
   module of this hybrid clustering algorithm, which is Entrophic Fuzzy
   Clustering. So, it can get the advantages of both algorithms. K-Means
   clustering algorithm can produce fast clustering solution due to its
   low-computation cost. But it can go for premature convergence. To
   overcome this problem, the second module used BHEFC, which can use large
   amount of high-frequency medical data. The experimental results are done
   with the medical practitioners to predict the risk factors of the heart
   disease patients and doctors can give the suggestions based on the risk
   factors. Finally, the efficiency of the proposed Hybrid K-Means and
   BHEFC is analyzed by three different performance measures.},

Abstract = {Rapidly growing GPS (Global Positioning System) trajectories hide much
   valuable information, such as city road planning, urban travel demand,
   and population migration. In order to mine the hidden information and to
   capture better clustering results, a trajectory regression clustering
   method (an unsupervised trajectory clustering method) is proposed to
   reduce local information loss of the trajectory and to avoid getting
   stuck in the local optimum. Using this method, we first define our new
   concept of trajectory clustering and construct a novel partitioning
   (angle-based partitioning) method of line segments; second, the
   Lagrange-based method and Hausdorff-based K-means++ are integrated in
   fuzzy C-means (FCM) clustering, which are used to maintain the stability
   and the robustness of the clustering process; finally, least squares
   regression model is employed to achieve regression clustering of the
   trajectory. In our experiment, the performance and effectiveness of our
   method is validated against real-world taxi GPS data. When comparing our
   clustering algorithm with the partition-based clustering algorithms
   (K-means, K-median, and FCM), our experimental results demonstrate that
   the presented method is more effective and generates a more reasonable
   trajectory.},

Abstract = {We propose a randomized greedy search algorithm to find a point estimate
   for a random partition based on a loss function and posterior Monte
   Carlo samples. Given the large size and awkward discrete nature of the
   search space, the minimization of the posterior expected loss is
   challenging. Our approach is a stochastic search based on a series of
   greedy optimizations performed in a random order and is embarrassingly
   parallel. We consider several loss functions, including Binder loss and
   variation of information. We note that criticisms of Binder loss are the
   result of using equal penalties of misclassification and we show an
   efficient means to compute Binder loss with potentially unequal
   penalties. Furthermore, we extend the original variation of information
   to allow for unequal penalties and show no increased computational
   costs. We provide a reference implementation of our algorithm. Using a
   variety of examples, we show that our method produces clustering
   estimates that better minimize the expected loss and are obtained faster
   than existing methods. for this article are available online.},

Abstract = {Data clustering is inevitable in today's era of data deluge. k-Means is
   a popular partition based clustering technique. However, with the
   increase in size and complexity of data, it is no longer suitable. There
   is an urgent need to shift towards parallel algorithms. We present a
   MapReduce based k-Means clustering, which is scalable and fault
   tolerant. The major advantage of our proposed work is that it
   dynamically determines the number of clusters, unlike k-Means where the
   final number of clusters has to be specified. MapReduce jobs are
   iteration sensitive as multiple read and write to the file system
   increase the cost as well as computation time. The algorithm proposed is
   not iterative one, it reads the data from and writes the output back to
   the file system once. We show that the proposed algorithm performs
   better than an Improved MapReduce based k-Means clustering algorithm.},

Abstract = {Numerous existing partitioning clustering algorithms, such as K-means.
   are developed to discover clusters that fit some of the static models.
   These algorithms may fail if it chooses a set of incorrect parameters in
   the static model with respect to the objects being clustered, or when
   the objects consist of patterns that are of non-spherical or not the
   same size. Furthermore, they could produce an instable result. This
   investigation presents a new partition clustering algorithm named SDCC.
   which can improve the problem of instable results in partitioning-based
   clustering, Such as K-means. As a hybrid approach that utilizes
   double-centroid concept, the proposed algorithm can eliminate the
   above-mentioned drawbacks to produce stable results while recognizing
   the non-spherical patterns and clusters that are not the same size.
   Experimental results illustrate that the new algorithm can identify
   non-spherical pattern correctly, and efficiently reduces the problem of
   long Computational time when applying KGA and GKA. It also indicates
   thin the proposed approach produces much smaller errors than K-means,
   KGA and GKA approaches in most cases examined herein.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a fast simulated annealing framework for combining
   multiple clusterings based on agreement measures between partitions,
   which are originally used to evaluate a clustering algorithm. Although
   we can follow a greedy strategy to optimize these measures as the
   objective functions of clustering ensemble, it may suffer from local
   convergence and simultaneously incur too large computational cost. To
   avoid local optima, we consider a simulated annealing optimization
   scheme that operates through single label changes. Moreover, for the
   measures between partitions based on the relationship (joined or
   separated) of pairs of objects, we can update them incrementally for
   each label change, which ensures that our optimization scheme is
   computationally feasible. The experimental evaluations demonstrate that
   the proposed framework can achieve promising results. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Abstract = {Clustering, as an unsupervised learning method and an important process
   in data mining, is an aspect of large and distributed data analysis. In
   many applications, such as peer-to-peer systems, huge volumes of data
   are distributed between multiple sources. Analysis of these volumes of
   data and identifying appropriate clusters is challenging due to
   transmission, processing and storage costs. In this paper, a
   gossip-based distributed clustering algorithm for P2P networks called
   Efficient GBDC-P2P is proposed, based on an improved gossip
   communicative approach by combining the peer sampeling and CYCLON
   protocol and the idea of partitioning-based data clustering. This
   algorithm is appropriate for data clustering in unstructured P2P
   networks, and it is adapted to the dynamic conditions of these networks.
   In the Efficient GBDC-P2P algorithm, distributed peers perform
   clustering operation in a distributed way only through local
   communications with their neighbors. Our approach does not rely on the
   central server to carry out data clustering task and without the need to
   synchronize operations. Evaluation results verify the efficiency of our
   proposed algorithm for data clustering in unstructured P2P networks.
   Furthermore, comparative analyses with other well-established
   distributed clustering approaches demonstrate the superior accuracy of
   the proposed method.},

Abstract = {Clustering is a NP-hard problem that is used to find the relationship
   between patterns in a given set of patterns. It is an unsupervised
   technique that is applied to obtain the optimal cluster centers,
   especially in partitioned based clustering algorithms. On the other
   hand, cat swarm optimization (CSO) is a new metaheuristic algorithm that
   has been applied to solve various optimization problems and it provides
   better results in comparison to other similar types of algorithms.
   However, this algorithm suffers from diversity and local optima
   problems. To overcome these problems, we are proposing an improved
   version of the CSO algorithm by using opposition-based learning and the
   Cauchy mutation operator. We applied the opposition-based learning
   method to enhance the diversity of the CSO algorithm and we used the
   Cauchy mutation operator to prevent the CSO algorithm from trapping in
   local optima. The performance of our proposed algorithm was tested with
   several artificial and real datasets and compared with existing methods
   like K-means, particle swarm optimization, and CSO. The experimental
   results show the applicability of our proposed method.},

Abstract = {K-Means is a widely used partition based clustering algorithm famous for
   its simplicity and speed. It organizes input dataset into predefined
   number of clusters. K-Means has a major limitation - the number of
   clusters, K, need to be pre-specified as an input. Pre-specifying K in
   the K-Means algorithm sometimes becomes difficult in absence of thorough
   domain knowledge, or for a new and unknown dataset. This limitation of
   advance specification of cluster number can lead to ``forced{''}
   clustering of data and proper classification does not emerge.
   In this paper, a new algorithm based on the K-Means is developed. This
   algorithm has advance features of intelligent data analysis and
   automatic generation of appropriate number of clusters. The clusters
   generated by the new algorithm are compared against results obtained
   with the original K-Means and various other famous clustering
   algorithms. This comparative analysis is done using sets of real data.},

Abstract = {Data mining is the process of discovering meaningful new correlation,
   patterns and trends by sifting through large amounts of data, using
   pattern recognition technologies as well as statistical and mathematical
   techniques. Cluster analysis is often used as one of the major data
   analysis technique widely applied for many practical applications in
   emerging areas of data mining. Two of the most delegated, partition
   based clustering algorithms namely k-Means and Fuzzy C-Means are
   analyzed in this research work. These algorithms are implemented by
   means of practical approach to analyze its performance, based on their
   computational time. The telecommunication data is the source data for
   this analysis. The connection oriented broad band data is used to find
   the performance of the chosen algorithms. The distance (Euclidian
   distance) between the server locations and their connections are
   rearranged after processing the data. The computational complexity
   (execution time) of each algorithm is analyzed and the results are
   compared with one another. By comparing the result of this practical
   approach, it was found that the results obtained are more accurate, easy
   to understand and above all the time taken to process the data was
   substantially high in Fuzzy C-Means algorithm than the k-Means. (C) 2014

Abstract = {Non-exclusive clustering is a partitioning based clustering scheme
   wherein the data points are clustered such that they belong to one or
   more clusters. Usually in real world applications, the datasets that we
   work with are not entirely exclusive in nature. In applications such as
   gene expression data analysis and satellite image processing,
   non-exclusive algorithms need to be employed for better and more
   accurate cluster analysis. Therefore, we intend to tackle such problems
   with a non-exclusive clustering algorithm, closely determined by a
   non-exclusivity score (NES). The NES is based on a feature class
   correlation measure, which helps to determine the significant overlap
   between the data points in the dataset and aids us in comprehending the
   clusters to which they belong to.},

Abstract = {A two-step procedure is developed for the exploratory mining of
   real-valued vector (multivariate) time series using partition-based
   clustering methods. The proposed procedure was tested with
   model-generated data, multiple sensor-based process data, as well as
   simulation data. The test results indicate that the proposed procedure
   is quite effective in producing better clustering results than a hidden
   Markov model (HMM)-based clustering method if there is a priori
   knowledge about the number of clusters in the data. Two existing
   validity indices were tested and found ineffective in determining the
   actual number of clusters. Determining the appropriate number of
   clusters in the case that there is no a priori knowledge is a known
   unresolved research issue not only for our proposed procedure but also
   for the HMM-based clustering method and further development is
   necessary. (c) 2007 Pattern Recognition Society. Published by Elsevier

Title = {A novel stratification clustering algorithm based on a new local density
   estimation method and an improved local inter-cluster distance measure},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING AND CYBERNETICS},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUN 23},
Abstract = {Recently clustering for datasets with different shapes, densities and
   noises has attracted more and more attention from scholars. However,
   most current clustering algorithms improve the clustering performance at
   the expense of the simplicity, and cannot balance well between the
   clustering quality and the operability for the users. To solve this
   problem, we propose a new algorithm called stratification clustering
   based on density, hierarchy and partition (SDHP) by effectively
   integrating the advantages of the density-based, hierarchical-based and
   partition-based clustering. First, a new parameter-free local density
   estimation strategy based on the bidirectional natural neighbor
   relationship named local density based on natural neighbor (NN-LD) is
   proposed to identify the core part of each sub-cluster. Then, a new
   stratification strategy based on the NN-LD Stratification-NN-LD
   (S-NN-LD) is proposed to divide the entire dataset into two layers, the
   core layer and the edge layer, to simplify the dataset structure and
   make the algorithm robust to noises. Next, the hierarchical-based
   single-linkage algorithm is adopted in the core layer to obtain the
   initial clustering result since it has advantages on clustering the
   datasets with various shapes and densities. Finally, to improve the
   clustering accuracy of samples in the edge layer, a combination of a new
   local inter-cluster distance measure based on the average of neighbor
   distances and the partitioning clustering is adopted to match these
   samples to the sub-clusters in the initial clustering result. The
   experiments on twenty datasets show that the SDHP has better clustering
   accuracy, and can be applied in practice well compared with four popular
   hierarchical clustering algorithms, four recent density-based clustering
   algorithms, and a state-of-the-art partitioning clustering algorithm.

Abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Contact tracing is a method to track the victims, which
   have been infected from the host with any particular disease. Therefore,
   clustering based machine learning techniques can be employed for contact
   tracing. Contact tracing can be automated by using technology and thus
   helps us in producing much more accurate and efficient results.
   OBJECTIVES: This work aims at finding usefulness of clustering
   techniques for contact tracing. Two different clustering techniques
   namely density-based clustering and partitioning-based clustering have
   been used to analyse corresponding results for COVID-19 infected cases.
   The dataset is generated from a mock data generator with certain
   assumptions.
   RESULTS: The paper compares DBSCAN and K-means for contact tracing for
   COVID-19 Pandemic. The comparative analysis of two algorithms is
   presented.
   CONCLUSION: The effectiveness of certain clustering algorithms in
   COVID-19 contact tracing is analysed. DBSCAN performs well for
   clustering tasks. This work only focuses on possible techniques useful
   for contact tracing and does not claim any medical accuracy.},

Title = {Adaptive Initialization Method for K-Means Algorithm},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {4},
Abstract = {The K-means algorithm is a widely used clustering algorithm that offers
   simplicity and efficiency. However, the traditional K-means algorithm
   uses a random method to determine the initial cluster centers, which
   make clustering results prone to local optima and then result in worse
   clustering performance. In this research, we propose an adaptive
   initialization method for the K-means algorithm (AIMK) which can adapt
   to the various characteristics in different datasets and obtain better
   clustering performance with stable results. For larger or
   higher-dimensional datasets, we even leverage random sampling in AIMK
   (name as AIMK-RS) to reduce the time complexity. 22 real-world datasets
   were applied for performance comparisons. The experimental results show
   AIMK and AIMK-RS outperform the current initialization methods and
   several well-known clustering algorithms. Specifically, AIMK-RS can
   significantly reduce the time complexity to O (n). Moreover, we exploit
   AIMK to initialize K-medoids and spectral clustering, and better
   performance is also explored. The above results demonstrate superior
   performance and good scalability by AIMK or AIMK-RS. In the future, we
   would like to apply AIMK to more partition-based clustering algorithms
   to solve real-life practical problems.},

Title = {Distributed structural clustering on large graph},
Journal = {CONCURRENCY AND COMPUTATION-PRACTICE \& EXPERIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 MAY 26},
Abstract = {Graph clustering is a primitive operation for graph data mining. It
   plays an important role to reveal community clusters, hubs, and outliers
   in complex networks. There are several graph clustering algorithms have
   been proposed based on the well-studied SCAN algorithm in recent years.
   However, SCAN and its improved sequential variants are prohibitively
   slow due to their iterative computations. The parallel variants are
   focusing on improving the efficiency of graph clustering by utilizing
   multi-cores computer architectures on single computing node with complex
   optimization techniques. Therefore, SCAN and its variants are not
   suitable for processing very large graphs due to the limitations of
   memory size and storage volume on a single node. In this article, we
   proposed a distributed parallel structural clustering algorithm using
   MapReduce. In order to improve the efficiency further, we proposed
   optimization techniques including partition based clustering and
   simplified combination with labels to accelerate the operations. We
   conducted extensive experiments on real world datasets. The experimental
   results showed our algorithm is high efficiency and scales well under
   different settings.},

Abstract = {The goal of image binarization is to classify the pixels into black and
   white correctly. Finding a threshold to binarize the image effectively
   is the essence in this study. This paper introduces a new algorithm for
   image binarization based on clustering. The algorithm computes on the
   histogram and uses the membership partition based on the distance
   between pixels within local spatial neighbors and clustering centers to
   accelerate the binarization procedure. Then the weighted factor is
   introduced to balance the noise-immunity and details. The proposed
   method combines the global and local ideas in the conventional
   algorithms. Compared with state-of-the-art algorithms, the proposed
   algorithm can universally obtain a robust effect for the images within
   distinct features, especially for the precision images.},

Abstract = {Hidden Markov model (HMM) is well known for sequence modeling and has
   been used for condition monitoring. However, HMM-based clustering
   methods are developed only recently. This article proposes a HMM-based
   clustering method for monitoring the condition of grinding wheel used in
   grinding operations. The proposed method first extract features from
   signals based on discrete wavelet decomposition using a moving window
   approach. It then generates a distance (dissimilarity) matrix using HMM.
   Based on this distance matrix several hierarchical and
   partitioning-based clustering algorithms are applied to obtain
   clustering results. The proposed methodology was tested with feature
   sequences extracted from acoustic emission signals. The results show
   that clustering accuracy is dependent upon cutting condition. Higher
   material removal rate seems to produce more discriminatory
   signals/features than lower material removal rate. The effect of window
   size, wavelet decomposition level, wavelet basis, clustering algorithm,
   and data normalization were also studied.},

Abstract = {Fuzzy co-clustering is a basic technique for revealing intrinsic
   co-cluster structures from cooccurrence information among objects and
   items. In most of fuzzy co-clustering algorithms, objects and items are
   partitioned based on different constraints. Objects are forced to be
   exclusively partitioned like as Fuzzy c-Means (FCM), while item
   memberships often represent just the relative significance of items in
   each cluster, i.e., items can be shared by multiple clusters. In a
   previous work, exclusive partition of items were achieved by introducing
   a penalty term in Fuzzy Clustering for Categorical Multivariate data
   (FCCM), which is an FCM-type co-clustering with entropy regularization
   mechanism. In this paper, the applicability of dual exclusive partition
   of objects and items are discussed in the frameworks of Fuzzy CoDoK and
   SCAD-based fuzzy co-clustering. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by

Title = {A fast partition method for wind pressure coefficient of large-span roof
   based on modified GK clustering},
Journal = {STRUCTURES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {30},
Pages = {518-530},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Structures with large-span roofs are particularly vulnerable to wind
   action, and evidences have shown that wind-induced damage of large-span
   roofs occurs mostly on edges and corners. This implies that different
   regions of large-span roofs may exhibit different degree of sensitivity
   to wind. It is therefore of substantial importance to partition the roof
   surface into different regions based on their respective vulnerability,
   which allows a better wind-resistant design. In this study, the concept
   of cluster analysis was extended for wind pressure coefficient (WPC)
   partitioning of large-span roofs, in which a fast partition method based
   on the modified GK clustering algorithm was employed to partition the
   WPC on two engineering cases, i.e., a cantilever flat roof and a curved
   roof. Its reliability was examined via comparative analysis of WPC
   distribution and the optimal zoning of WPC derived by cluster analysis.
   The optimal number of clusters was identified using clustering validity
   indices. The comparisons were overall satisfactory, both in quantitative
   and qualitative sense. The optimal zoning results of WPC reflect well
   the characteristics of WPC distribution. It is expected that the
   methodology applied in this study can be well used to aid the
   wind-resistant design of other similar structure systems.},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Basing cluster analysis on mixture models has become a classical and
   powerful approach. Until now, this approach, which allows to explain
   some classic clustering criteria such as the well-known k-means criteria
   and to propose general criteria, has been developed to classify a set of
   objects measured on a set of variables. But, for this kind of data, if
   most clustering procedures are designated to construct an optimal
   partition of objects or, sometimes, of variables, there exist others
   methods, named block clustering methods, which consider simultaneously
   the two sets and organize the data into homogeneous blocks.
   In this work, a new mixture model called block mixture model is proposed
   to take into account this situation. This model allows to embed
   simultaneous clustering of objects and variables in a mixture approach.
   We first consider this probabilistic model in a general context and we
   develop a new algorithm of simultaneous partitioning based on the CEM
   algorithm. Then, we focus on the case of binary data and we show that
   our approach allows us to extend a block clustering method, which had
   been proposed in this case, Simplicity. fast convergence and the
   possibility to process large data sets are the major advantages of the
   proposed approach. (C) 2002 Pattern Recognition Society. Published by

Abstract = {Cluster validation, which is the process of evaluating the quality of
   clustering results, plays an important role for practical machine
   learning systems. Categorical sequences, such as biological sequences in
   computational biology, have become common in real-world applications.
   Different from previous studies, which mainly focused on attribute-value
   data, in this paper, we work on the cluster validation problem for
   categorical sequences. The evaluation of sequences clustering is
   currently difficult due to the lack of an internal validation criterion
   defined with regard to the structural features hidden in sequences. To
   solve this problem, in this paper, a novel cluster validity index (CVI)
   is proposed as a function of clustering, with the intracluster
   structural compactness and intercluster structural separation linearly
   combined to measure the quality of sequence clusters. A partition-based
   algorithm for robust clustering of categorical sequences is also
   proposed, which provides the new measure with high-quality clustering
   results by the deterministic initialization and the elimination of noise
   clusters using an information theoretic method. The new clustering
   algorithm and the CVI are then assembled within the common model
   selection procedure to determine the number of clusters in categorical
   sequence sets. A case study on commonly used protein sequences and the
   experimental results on some real-world sequence sets from different
   domains are given to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method.},

Abstract = {In traditional approaches for clustering market basket type data,
   relations among transactions are modeled according to the items
   occurring in these transactions. However, an individual item might
   induce different relations in different contexts. Since such contexts
   might be captured by interesting patterns in the overall data, we
   represent each transaction as a set of patterns through modifying the
   conventional pattern semantics. By clustering the patterns in the
   dataset, we infer a clustering of the transactions represented this way.
   For this, we propose a novel hypergraph model to represent the relations
   among the patterns. Instead of a local measure that depends only on
   common items among patterns, we propose a global measure that is based
   on the cooccurences of these patterns in the overall data. The success
   of existing hypergraph partitioning based algorithms in other domains
   depends on sparsity of the hypergraph and explicit objective metrics.
   For this, we propose a two-phase clustering approach for the above
   hypergraph, which is expected to be dense. In the first phase, the
   vertices of the hypergraph are merged in a multilevel algorithm to
   obtain large number of high quality clusters. Here, we propose new
   quality metrics for merging decisions in hypergraph clustering
   specifically for this domain. In order to enable the use of existing
   metrics in the second phase, we introduce a vertex-to-cluster affinity
   concept to devise a method for constructing a sparse hypergraph based on
   the obtained clustering. The experiments we have performed show the
   effectiveness of the proposed framework.},

Title = {Holo-Entropy Based Categorical Data Hierarchical Clustering},
Journal = {INFORMATICA},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {28},
Number = {2},
Pages = {303-328},
Abstract = {Clustering high-dimensional data is a challenging task in data mining,
   and clustering high-dimensional categorical data is even more
   challenging because it is more difficult to measure the similarity
   between categorical objects. Most algorithms assume feature independence
   when computing similarity between data objects, or make use of
   computationally demanding techniques such as PCA for numerical data.
   Hierarchical clustering algorithms are often based on similarity
   measures computed on a common feature space, which is not effective when
   clustering high dimensional data. Subspace clustering algorithms
   discover feature subspaces for clusters, but are mostly partition-based;
   i.e. they do not produce a hierarchical structure of clusters. In this
   paper, we propose a hierarchical algorithm for clustering
   high-dimensional categorical data, based on a recently proposed
   information-theoretical concept named holo-entropy. The algorithm
   proposes new ways of exploring entropy, holo-entropy and attribute
   weighting in order to determine the feature subspace of a cluster and to
   merge clusters even though their feature subspaces differ. The algorithm
   is tested on UCI datasets, and compared with several state-of-the-art
   algorithms. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm yields
   higher efficiency and accuracy than the competing algorithms and allows
   higher reproducibility.},

Title = {Analysing microarray expression data through effective clustering},
Journal = {INFORMATION SCIENCES},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {262},
Pages = {32-45},
Month = {MAR 20},
Abstract = {The recent advances in genomic technologies and the availability of
   large-scale microarray datasets call for the development of advanced
   data analysis techniques, such as data mining and statistical analysis
   to cite a few. Among the mining techniques proposed so far, cluster
   analysis has become a standard method for the analysis of microarray
   expression data. It can be used both for initial screening of patients
   and for extraction of disease molecular signatures. Moreover, clustering
   can be profitably exploited to characterize genes of unknown function
   and uncover patterns that can be interpreted as indications of the
   status of cellular processes. Finally, clustering biological data would
   be useful not only for exploring the data but also for discovering
   implicit links between the objects. To this end, several clustering
   approaches have been proposed in order to obtain a good trade-off
   between accuracy and efficiency of the clustering process. In
   particular, great attention has been devoted to hierarchical clustering
   algorithms for their accuracy in unsupervised identification and
   stratification of groups of similar genes or patients, while, partition
   based approaches are exploited when fast computations are required.
   Indeed, it is well known that no existing clustering algorithm
   completely satisfies both accuracy and efficiency requirements, thus a
   good clustering algorithm has to be evaluated with respect to some
   external criteria that are independent from the metric being used to
   compute clusters. In this paper, we propose a clustering algorithm
   called M-CLUBS (for Microarray data CLustering Using Binary Splitting)
   exhibiting higher accuracy than the hierarchical ones proposed so far
   while allowing a faster computation with respect to partition based
   approaches. Indeed, M-CLUBS is faster and more accurate than other
   algorithms, including k-means and its recently proposed refinements, as
   we will show in the experimental section. The algorithm consists of a
   divisive phase and an agglomerative phase; during these two phases, the
   samples are repartitioned using a least quadratic distance criterion
   possessing unique analytical properties that we exploit to achieve a
   very fast computation. M-CLUBS derives good clusters without requiring
   input from users, and it is robust and impervious to noise, while
   providing better speed and accuracy than methods, such as BIRCH, that
   are endowed with the same critical properties. Due to the structural
   feature of microarray data (they are represented as arrays of numeric
   values), M-CLUBS is suitable for analyzing them since it is designed to
   perform well for Euclidean distances. In order to stronger the obtained
   results we Interpreted the obtained clusters by a domain expert and the
   evaluation by quality measures specifically tailored for biological
   validity assessment. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

   clustering approach, when applied to VQ based image compression, aptly
   demonstrates that the transition from fuzzy to crisp mode is more
   efficient compared to the known approaches and is also independent of
   the choice of the initial codebook vector. The technique is also fast
   and easy to implement, and has rapid convergence. Several experimental
   results are presented to demonstrate its distinct advantage over other
   commonly used algorithms for image compression.},

Abstract = {A new data clustering algorithm Density oriented Kernelized version of
   Fuzzy c-means with new distance metric (DKFCM-new) is proposed. It
   creates noiseless clusters by identifying and assigning noise points
   into separate cluster. In an earlier work, Density Based Fuzzy C-Means
   (DOFCM) algorithm with Euclidean distance metric was proposed which only
   considered the distance between cluster centroid and data points. In
   this paper, we tried to improve the performance of DOFCM by
   incorporating a new distance measure that has also considered the
   distance variation within a cluster to regularize the distance between a
   data point and the cluster centroid. This paper presents the kernel
   version of the method. Experiments are done using two-dimensional
   synthetic data-sets, standard data-sets referred from previous papers
   like DUNN data-set, Bensaid data-set and real life high dimensional
   data-sets like Wisconsin Breast cancer data, Iris data. Proposed method
   is compared with other kernel methods, various noise resistant methods
   like PCM, PFCM, CFCM, NC and credal partition based clustering methods
   like ECM, RECM, CECM. Results shown that proposed algorithm
   significantly outperforms its earlier version and other competitive

Abstract = {Drawback of almost partition based clustering algorithms is the
   requirement for the number of clusters specified at the beginning.
   Identifying the true number of clusters at the beginning is a difficult
   problem. So far, there were some works studied on this issue but no
   method is perfect in every case. This paper proposes a method to find
   the appropriate number of clusters in the clustering process by making
   an index indicated the appropriate number of clusters. This index is
   built from the infra-cluster coefficient and inter-cluster coefficient.
   The infra-cluster coefficient reflects infra-distortion of the cluster.
   The inter-cluster coefficient reflects the distance among clusters.
   Those coefficients are made only by extremely marginal objects of
   clusters. The looking for the extremely marginal objects and the
   building of the index are integrated in a weighted FCM algorithm and it
   is calculated suitably while the weighted Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) is
   processing. The Extended weighted FCM algorithm integrated this index is
   called Fuzzy C-Means-Extended (FCM-E). Not only does the FCM-E seek the
   clusters, but it also finds the appropriate number of clusters. The
   authors experiment with the FCM-E on some data sets of University of
   California, Irvine (UCI): Iris, Wine, Breast Cancer Wisconsin, and Glass
   and compare the results of the proposed method with the results of the
   other methods. The results of proposed method obtained are encouraging.},

Abstract = {Clustering has been the most popular method for data exploration.
   Clustering is partitioning the data set into sub-partitions based on
   some measures say the distance measure, each partition has its own
   significant information. There are a number of algorithms explored for
   this purpose, one such algorithm is the Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO)
   which is a population based heuristic search technique derived from
   swarm intelligence. In this paper we present an improved version of the
   Particle Swarm Optimization where, each feature of the data set is given
   significance accordingly by adding some random weights, which also
   minimizes the distortions in the dataset if any. The performance of the
   above proposed algorithm is evaluated using some benchmark datasets from
   Machine Learning Repository. The experimental results shows that our
   proposed methodology performs significantly better than the previously
   performed experiments.},

Abstract = {Image segmentation is the process to divide a digital image into a
   number of regions for further analysis in the area of computer vision.
   Color images can be segmented by applying various clustering algorithms
   such as DBSCAN, which can identify the arbitrary shaped clusters. The
   drawback of DBSCAN is the high computational complexity whilst the sizes
   of image datasets are normally very large. This paper proposes a hybrid
   method of K-means and DBSCAN (Koreans-DBSCAN) for image segmentation.
   K-means is the common partition-based clustering approach to reduce the
   size of image dataset. Four benchmarking image segmentation cases are
   used for evaluating the usability of proposed Kmeans-DBSCAN method.},

Abstract = {The structural balance theory offers a comprehensive way to understand
   stability and tensions in social systems. However, most of the real
   social networks are unbalanced in which people are not exclusively
   divided into groups such that people within a group are friendly to each
   other but hostile to everyone in other groups. That is, there are
   conflict edges in a partition regardless of how we divide people in a
   given social network. The natural question to ask is that how many
   conflict edges should be changed to make a network balanced.
   Alternatively, the clustering problem is formulated to optimize minimum
   conflicts or maximum balanceness. In this paper, utilizing the
   relationship between balancedness and spectrum space, we propose a
   spectral algorithm based leading eigenvectors of signed networks to
   partition clusters and make balancedness maximum. The spectral algorithm
   is a two stages approach, partition subnetworks corresponding to
   temporary clusters to increase the objective value and fine-tune
   partition based on the fitness of nodes. The robustness of the algorithm
   is completely dependent on the adjacent matrixes of signed networks. And
   it can measure the balanceness of network in global way with the lowest
   errors. The experimental results on both real signed networks and
   synthetic networks demonstrate that the leading eigenvector based method
   is highly effective and accuracy. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {K-Medoids algorithm is a partition-based algorithm, which has the
   characteristics of simple implementation, strong robustness, and high
   accuracy. However, it has some disadvantages, such as strong dependence
   on the selection of initial center, the unknown number of classification
   K, high resource cost of frequent iteration of the algorithm, and poor
   clustering effect for mass data. In order to solve these problems, the
   original K-Medoids algorithm was improved by introducing the Canopy
   algorithm and the Max-Min distance algorithm, and K points were selected
   as the initial center of the cluster. In the era of big data, we use the
   MapReduce computing framework to parallefize the algorithm. The
   experimental results show that: the improved clustering algorithm not
   only has a good speedup, but also improves the clustering accuracy and
   convergence, and shows a large performance advantage in dealing with
   large-scale data.},

Abstract = {In this paper a new multiobjective (MO) clustering technique
   (GenClustMOO) is proposed which can automatically partition the data
   into an appropriate number of clusters. Each cluster is divided into
   several small hyperspherical subclusters and the centers of all these
   small sub-clusters are encoded in a string to represent the whole
   clustering. For assigning points to different clusters, these local
   subclusters are considered individually. For the purpose of objective
   function evaluation, these sub-clusters are merged appropriately to form
   a variable number of global clusters. Three objective functions, one
   reflecting the total compactness of the partitioning based on the
   Euclidean distance, the other reflecting the total symmetry of the
   clusters, and the last reflecting the cluster connectedness, are
   considered here. These are optimized simultaneously using AMOSA, a newly
   developed simulated annealing based multiobjective optimization method,
   in order to detect the appropriate number of clusters as well as the
   appropriate partitioning. The symmetry present in a partitioning is
   measured using a newly developed point symmetry based distance.
   Connectedness present in a partitioning is measured using the relative
   neighborhood graph concept. Since AMOSA, as well as any other MO
   optimization technique, provides a set of Pareto-optimal solutions, a
   new method is also developed to determine a single solution from this
   set. Thus the proposed GenClustMOO is able to detect the appropriate
   number of clusters and the appropriate partitioning from data sets
   having either well-separated clusters of any shape or symmetrical
   clusters with or without overlaps. The effectiveness of the proposed
   GenClustMOO in comparison with another recent multiobjective clustering
   technique (MOCK), a single objective genetic algorithm based automatic
   clustering technique (VGAPS-clustering), K-means and single linkage
   clustering techniques is comprehensively demonstrated for nineteen
   artificial and seven real-life data sets of varying complexities. In a
   part of the experiment the effectiveness of AMOSA as the underlying
   optimization technique in GenClustMOO is also demonstrated in comparison
   to another evolutionary MO algorithm, PESA2. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All

   given data set in partitioning based clustering algorithms. Hence, it is
   important to identify them. We propose a density with distance based
   method which ensures identification of seed artefacts from different
   clusters that leads to more accurate clustering results. Our algorithm
   improves on the search for initial seed artefacts iteratively until the
   minimum value of the sum of within sum errors, normalized by their data
   sizes, is ensured. This is because the initial artefacts are selected
   from different clusters. Here the choice of seed artefacts guarantees a
   global optimum clustering solution. We have compared our results with
   random, Wu, Cao and Khan's methods of initial seed artefact selection,
   to show the efficacy of our method. (c) 2018 The Authors. Production and

Abstract = {In this paper, the problem of simultaneous feature selection and
   automatic clustering is formulated as a multi-objective optimization
   task. Studying the patterns hidden in gene expression data helps to
   understand the functionality of genes. But due to the large volume of
   genes and the highly complex biological networks some sophisticated
   techniques are required to study available data consisting of large
   number of measurements. In general clustering techniques are used to
   identify natural partitioning and detect some interesting patterns from
   the given data as a first step of studying the gene expression data. But
   in general all the features present in the data set may not be important
   for clustering purpose. Thus appropriate selection of features from the
   set of all features is very much relevant from clustering point of view.
   A modern simulated annealing based multiobjective optimization technique
   namely AMOSA is utilized as the background optimization methodology.
   Here features and cluster centers are represented in the form of a
   string. Three optimization criteria are utilized: i) a function
   representing the total compactness of the partitioning based on the
   Euclidean distance, ii) a function representing the total compactness of
   the partitioning based on the point symmetry based distance and iii) a
   function counting the number of features. The objective is to optimize
   values of cluster validity indices where as to increase the number of
   features in order to remove the bias of internal cluster validity
   indices on dimensionality. Appropriate subset of features, proper number
   of clusters and the proper partitioning are determined using the search
   capability of AMOSA. In order to assign cluster label to all points, a
   recently introduced distance, namely point symmetry based distance, is
   utilized. Thus the effectiveness of this proposed Fea-GenClustMOO
   technique is shown for automatically clustering publicly available
   gene-expression data sets. Results are},

Abstract = {investigating relationships in information is an important component of
   statistical and spatial analysis. Clustering techniques have proven to
   be effective in helping to find patterns or relationships which
   otherwise may not have been detected. One of the most popular
   partitioning based clustering approaches is k-means. In this paper we
   explore the application of the k-means approach to spatial information
   in order to assess its characteristic features. One aspect of concern is
   implementation in commercial statistical software packages. In
   particular, the invariable sub-optimality (or poor solution quality) of
   identified clusters will be investigated. Another aspect of evaluation
   is a direct comparison to an alternative, spatially-based clustering
   approach. Although numerous authors over the past 30 or so years have
   discussed shortcomings associated with the use of the k-means approach,
   empirically based work which illustrates biasing effects is lacking.
   This paper contributes to the further understanding of clustering
   techniques.},

Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON FUZZY SYSTEMS},
Year = {2015},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {As generated by clustering algorithms, clusterings (or partitions) are
   hypotheses on data explanation which are better evaluated by experts
   fromthe application domain. In general, clustering algorithms allow a
   limited usage of domain knowledge about the cluster formation process.
   In this study, we propose both a design technique and a new
   partitioning-based clustering algorithm which can be used to assist the
   data analyst while looking for a set of meaningful clusters, i.e.,
   clusters that actually correspond to the underlying data structure.
   Following an observer metaphor according to which the perception of a
   group of objects depends on the observer position-the closer an observer
   is from an image more details (s) he perceives-we resort to shrinkage to
   incorporate a regularization term, accounting for the observation point,
   within the objective function of an otherwise unbiased clustering
   algorithm. This technique allows our resulting biased algorithm to
   generate a set of reasonable partitions, i.e., partitions validated by a
   given cluster validity index, corresponding to views of data with
   different levels of granularity (levels of detail) in different regions
   of the data space. For the illustration of the design technique, we
   adopted the fuzzy c-means (FCM) algorithm as the unbiased clustering
   algorithm and include a convergence theorem assuring that changing the
   point of observation in the corresponding biased algorithm FCM with
   focal point (FCMFP) does not jeopardize its convergence. Experimental
   studies on both synthetic and real data are included to illustrate the
   usefulness of the approach. In addition, and as a convenient side effect
   of using shrinkage, the experimental results suggest that our biased
   algorithm (FCMFP) not only seems to scale better than the successive
   runs of the unbiased one (FCM) but on the average, seems to produce
   clusters exhibiting higher validity index values as well. In addition,
   less sensitivity to initialization was observed for the biased algorithm
   when compared with the unbiased one.},

   which consists of global ordering and local ordering. In the global
   ordering, the algorithm forms clusters from n given vertices and orders
   the clusters. In the local ordering, the elements in each cluster are
   linearly ordered. The linear order, thus produced, is used to obtain
   optimal k-way partitioning based on scaled cost objective function.
   Experiment with 11 benchmark circuits for k-way (2 less than or equal to
   k less than or equal to 10) partitioning shows that the proposed
   algorithm yields an average of 10.6\% improvement over MELO for the
   k-way scaled cost partitioning.},

Abstract = {Water Network Partitioning (WNP) is among the most attractive and
   studied strategies for the improvement of the Water Distribution Network
   (WDN) management. The proper definition of subregions (called clusters
   or districts) with high link density between nodes in the same group,
   and a relatively low link density between nodes in different groups, is
   a crucial aspect for the partitioning of a water system. If on one hand
   the definition of these monitored sub-areas, called District Metered
   Areas (DMAs), allows simplifying the water balance, the pressure
   control, the water leaks identification and the water quality
   protection, on the other hand it may worsen the hydraulic performance
   and the reliability of the system. In this paper, two clustering
   algorithms, graph partitioning based on a Multi-Level Recursive
   Bisection and Spectral Clustering, were used to define the districts.
   Some of the major geometrical and hydraulic characteristics of the
   network has been adopted as weights in the partitioning procedure. A
   comparison between the two clustering methods was made for a real water
   network of the South Italy, Parete, evaluating some clustering quality
   and hydraulic indices, in order to define the algorithm and the weight
   which work better for the definition of the optimal clustering layout.},

Title = {TECM: Transfer learning-based evidential c-means clustering},
Journal = {KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {257},
Month = {DEC 5},
Abstract = {Asa representative evidential clustering algorithm, evidential c-means
   (ECM) provides a deeper insight into the data by allowing an object to
   belong not only to a single class, but also to any subset of a
   collection of classes, which generalizes the hard, fuzzy, possibilistic,
   and rough partitions. However, compared with other partition-based
   algorithms, ECM must estimate numerous additional parameters, and thus
   insufficient or contaminated data will have a greater influence on its
   clustering performance. To solve this problem, in this study, a transfer
   learning-based ECM (TECM) algorithm is proposed by introducing the
   strategy of transfer learning into the process of evidential clustering.
   The TECM objective function is constructed by integrating the knowledge
   learned from the source domain with the data in the target domain to
   cluster the target data. Subsequently, an alternate optimization scheme
   is developed to solve the constraint objective function of the TECM
   algorithm. The proposed TECM algorithm is applicable to cases where the
   source and target domains have the same or different numbers of
   clusters. A series of experiments were conducted on both synthetic and
   real datasets, and the experimental results demonstrated the
   effectiveness of the proposed TECM algorithm compared to ECM and other
   representative multitask or transfer-clustering algorithms. (c) 2022

Abstract = {K-means clustering algorithm is a partition based clustering algorithm
   which has been widely used in data mining applications. This algorithm
   suffers from an issue, named initial centers selection. This problem
   significantly effects on the quality and running time of clustering.
   Several literatures discussed on this problem and try to select the best
   initial centers to prevent final results from getting into local minimum
   and inaccurate results. Although initial center selection decreases the
   total running time, it imposes a time overhead that can be solved by
   parallel design. In addition, previous solutions didn't consider the
   algorithm behavior after selecting the initial centers, which is
   considered by dynamic correction in this work. Graphic Processing Unites
   has several parallel cores which provide a parallel device for
   developers. This paper proposes a parallel initial centers selection and
   dynamic center correction on GPU which is fast, accurate and scalable.},

Abstract = {Database-as-a-Service (DAS) is an emerging database management paradigm
   wherein querying on encrypted data directly is a performance critical
   problem, to which partition based index is an effective solution. For
   multi-dimensional range query, generating partition on each dimension
   would increase information leakage to a large extent, while previous
   multi-dimensional partition would cause large efficiency loss,
   especially when the data distribution is sparse. To achieve guaranteed
   security with much less efficiency loss, in this paper we propose
   cluster based multi-dimensional partition (CBMP). First, CBMP decompose
   the whole space into clusters, which only cover non-empty area. To get
   better clustering effect, a new cluster criteria based on full neighbor
   is proposed. Second, since optimal secure partition is NP-hard, several
   heuristic based algorithms including distance based and Hilbert based
   are proposed. Experiments on real dataset and synthetic dataset show
   that distance based algorithm could achieve approximately least
   efficiency loss.},

Abstract = {To find the best partition of a large and complex network into a small
   number of clusters has been addressed in many different ways. However,
   the probabilistic setting in which each node has a certain probability
   of belonging to a certain cluster has been scarcely discussed. In this
   paper, a fuzzy partitioning formulation, which is extended from a
   deterministic framework for network partition based on the optimal
   prediction of a random walker Markovian dynamics, is derived to solve
   this problem. The algorithms are constructed to minimize the objective
   function under this framework. It is demonstrated by the simulation
   experiments that our algorithms can efficiently determine the
   probabilities with which a node belongs to different clusters during the
   learning process. Moreover, they are successfully applied to two
   real-world networks, including the social interactions between members
   of a karate club and the relationships of some books on American
   politics bought from Amazon.com. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {This study focuses on the possibility of remote monitoring and screening
   of Parkinson's and age-related voice impairment for the general public
   using self-recorded data on readily available or emerging technologies
   such as Smartphone and IoT devices. While most studies use
   professionally recorded voice in a controlled environment, this study
   uses self-recorded sustained vowel /a/ recordings using iPhone. Each
   healthy control (HC) and people with Parkinson's (PWP) group has 57
   age-matching mixed-gender subjects. The control subjects can have
   age-related voice impairment. Without severity labels, features
   extracted from the recordings were grouped by their similarity in voice
   using unsupervised learning with various clustering methods. The optimal
   number of clusters (K) was estimated using direct and statistical
   methods. The estimated K does not agree with the defined Unified
   Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale-Speech (UPDRS-3.1) scales. Using K = 4,
   five hierarchical and one partition-based clustering were used for
   comparison and cross-checking. The hierarchical-based methods are
   Hierarchical Cluster (HCluster), Hierarchical K-Means (HKMeans),
   Agglomerative Nesting (AGNES), Divisive Analysis (DIANA), and neural
   network-based Self-Organized Tree Algorithm (SOTA). The partition-based
   method is Clustering Large Applications (CLARA). Three internal
   validation indices: connectivity, Dunn index and silhouette width, were
   used to measure the compactness of the clusters and their separations.
   The validation result, ordered from the best, is AGNES, HCluster, DIANA,
   HKMeans, CLARA, and SOTA. Majority vote was applied to the results from
   AGNES, HCluster and DIANA to obtain the final grouping. Five groups were
   defined representing outliers, severely impaired voice, minor impaired,
   healthier voice, and cannot be grouped. All methods identified the same
   two outliers except SOTA. The clustering and voting have successfully
   identified the 2 outliers, 5 more severely impaired, 82 minor impaired,
   and 22 healthier voice. Only 3 could not be grouped. Feature extraction
   has reduced the data size by a factor of 518. It is possible to first
   reduce the data size for transmission and perform unsupervised learning
   at the receiving end for remote monitoring and screening.},

   clustering method with a specially designed distance function that
   considers the effect of sensitive terms in the privacy goal as part of
   the clustering process. In this way, when the clustering minimises the
   total intra-cluster distances of the partition, the utility loss is also
   minimised. We present two algorithms DocClust and DetK for clustering

Title = {Slabpose columnsort: A new oblivious algorithm for out-of-core sorting
   on distributed-memory clusters},
Journal = {ALGORITHMICA},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {45},
Number = {3},
Pages = {483-508},

Abstract = {Our goal is to develop a robust out-of-core sorting program for a
   distributed-memory cluster. The literature contains two dominant
   paradigms for out-of-core sorting algorithms: merging-based and
   partitioning-based. We explore a third paradigm, that of oblivious
   algorithms. Unlike the two dominant paradigms, oblivious algorithms do
   not depend on the input keys and therefore lead to predetermined I/O and
   communication patterns in an out-of-core setting. Predetermined I/O and
   communication patterns facilitate overlapping I/O, communication, and
   computation for efficient implementation. We have developed several
   out-of-core sorting programs using the paradigm of oblivious algorithms.
   Our baseline implementation, 3-pass columnsort, was based on Leighton's
   columnsort algorithm. Though efficient in terms of I/O and
   communication, 3-pass columnsort has a restriction on the maximum
   problem size. As our first effort toward relaxing this restriction, we
   developed two implementations: subblock columnsort and M-columnsort.
   Both of these implementations incur substantial performance costs:
   subblock columnsort performs additional disk I/O, and M-columnsort needs
   substantial amounts of extra communication and computation. In this
   paper we present slabpose columnsort, a new oblivious algorithm that we
   have designed explicitly for the out-of-core setting. Slabpose
   columnsort relaxes the problem-size restriction at no extra I/O or
   communication cost. Experimental evidence on a Beowulf cluster shows
   that unlike subblock columnsort and M-columnsort, slabpose columnsort
   runs almost as fast as 3-pass columnsort. To the best of our knowledge,
   our implementations are the first out-of-core multiprocessor sorting
   algorithms that make no assumptions about the keys and produce output
   that is perfectly load balanced and in the striped order assumed by the
   Parallel Disk Model.},

Abstract = {Clustering task has been greatly developed in recent years like
   partition-based and graph-based methods. However, in terms of improving
   robustness, most existing algorithms only focus on noise and outliers
   between data, while ignoring the noise in feature space. To deal with
   this situation, we propose a novel weight learning mechanism to
   adaptively reweight each feature in the data. Combining with the
   clustering task, we further propose a robust fuzzy K-Means model based
   on the auto-weighted feature learning, which can effectively reduce the
   proportion of noisy features. Besides, a regularization term is
   introduced into our model to make the sample-to-clusters memberships of
   each sample have suitable sparsity. Specifically, we design an effective
   strategy to determine the value of the regularization parameter. The
   experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets
   demonstrate that our model has better performance than other classical
   algorithms.},

   fuzzy C-means (LPFCM) clustering method and its optimization are
   presented. An orthogonally projected space, which preserves the locality
   of structural properties, can be generated in LPFCM, thus enhancing the
   capability of fuzzy C-means (FCM) for handling high-dimensional data. It
   is the first time to introduce projection techniques to the FCM
   optimization objective function directly, and the ideas of fuzzy
   clustering, geometric structure preservation and feature extraction are
   seamlessly integrated. LPFCM is also regarded as a unified model that
   combines two separate stages of spectral clustering. Experimental
   results on some benchmark data sets show the effectiveness of LPFCM in
   comparison with FCM and some state-of-the-art methods. (c) 2020 Elsevier

Abstract = {Clustering on large databases has been studied actively as all
   increasing number of applications involve huge amount of data. In this
   paper, we propose all efficient top-down approach for density-based
   clustering, which is based on the density information stored in index
   nodes of a multidimensional index. We first provide a formal definition
   of the cluster based on the concept of region contrast partition. Based
   on this notion, we propose a novel top-down clustering algorithm, which
   improves the efficiency through branch-and-bound pruning. For this
   pruning, we present a technique for determining the bounds based oil
   sparse and dense internal regions and formally prove the correctness of
   the bounds. Experimental results show that the proposed method reduces
   the elapsed time by up to 96 times compared with that of BIRCH, which is
   a well-known clustering method. The results also show that the
   performance improvement becomes more marked as the size of the database
   increases. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Data stream is relatively new and emerging domain in the current era of
   Internet advancement. Clustering data streams is equally important and
   difficult because of the numerous hurdles attached to it. A number of
   algorithms have been proposed to offer solutions for efficient
   clustering. Grid based clustering approach was adopted few years ago to
   overcome the limitations of conventional partition-based algorithms for
   data stream clustering. Data points are mapped to the grid-cells to form
   micro-clusters which later are used for clustering. Using density in the
   clustering process is proved to be a remarkable success and in recent
   years many researchers have used density to find arbitrary shaped \&
   density clusters and identify outliers. Concept of density-based
   clustering is to use grid-based clustering at core and create a
   distinction between dense and sparse grids using density threshold
   values and use dense grids to yield clustering results; which provide
   more cluster purity and accuracy. In this paper, we reviewed grid based
   data stream clustering algorithms which utilize density. We evaluated
   their functionalities and identified their limitations. In the end, we
   critically evaluated different aspects of algorithms and suggested one
   of these algorithms which is better in terms of performance and
   accuracy.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF BIG DATA},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {Clustering a big dataset without knowing the number of clusters presents
   a big challenge to many existing clustering algorithms. In this paper,
   we propose a Random Sample Partition-based Centers Ensemble (RSPCE)
   algorithm to identify the number of clusters in a big dataset. In this
   algorithm, a set of disjoint random samples is selected from the big
   dataset, and the I-niceDP algorithm is used to identify the number of
   clusters and initial centers in each sample. Subsequently, a cluster
   ball model is proposed to merge two clusters in the random samples that
   are likely sampled from the same cluster in the big dataset. Finally,
   based on the ball model, the RSPCE ensemble method is used to ensemble
   the results of all samples into the final result as a set of initial
   cluster centers in the big dataset. Intensive experiments were conducted
   on both synthetic and real datasets to validate the feasibility and
   effectiveness of the proposed RSPCE algorithm. The experimental results
   show that the ensemble result from multiple random samples is a reliable
   approximation of the actual number of clusters, and the RSPCE algorithm
   is scalable to big data.},

Title = {Determination of the appropriate parameters for K-means clustering using
   selection of region clusters based on density DBSCAN (SRCD-DBSCAN)},
Journal = {EXPERT SYSTEMS},
Year = {2017},

Abstract = {K-means clustering can be highly accurate when the number of clusters
   and the initial cluster centre are appropriate. An inappropriate
   determination of the number of clusters or the initial cluster centre
   decreases the accuracy of K-means clustering. However, determining these
   values is problematic. To solve these problems, we used density-based
   spatial clustering of application with noise (DBSCAN) because it does
   not require a predetermined number of clusters; however, it has some
   significant drawbacks. Using DBSCAN with high-dimensional data and data
   with potentially different densities decreases the accuracy to some
   degree. Therefore, the objective of this research is to improve the
   efficiency of DBSCAN through a selection of region clusters based on
   density DBSCAN to automatically find the appropriate number of clusters
   and initial cluster centres for K-means clustering. In the proposed
   method, DBSCAN is used to perform clustering and to select the
   appropriate clusters by considering the density of each cluster.
   Subsequently, the appropriate region data are chosen from the selected
   clusters. The experimental results yield the appropriate number of
   clusters and the appropriate initial cluster centres for K-means
   clustering. In addition, the results of the selection of region clusters
   based on density DBSCAN method are more accurate than those obtained by
   traditional methods, including DBSCAN and K-means and related methods
   such as Partitioning-based DBSCAN (PDBSCAN) and PDBSCAN by applying the
   Ant Clustering Algorithm DBSCAN (PACA-DBSCAN).},

Abstract = {Clustering is one of the major tasks in the field of data mining. The
   main aim of the clustering is grouping the data or similar objects into
   one group based on their data find the similarity between the objects.
   Clustering of uncertain data have been becoming the major issues in the
   mining uncertain data for data mining or applications. Clustering
   uncertain data problems have been solved in many ways with the help of
   data mining techniques or algorithm. In recent work many data mining
   algorithms solve the issues of the uncertain data object. Generally
   uncertain data objects can be solved in two ways: measuring the
   similarity between the data objects or clustered data, measuring the
   similarity with data objects with Probability Distribution functions.
   Measuring the similarity between the data objects is based on a
   similarity distance measure and further clustered with density based
   clustering or hierarchical clustering methods. In recent years, a
   numeral of indirect data gathering methodologies has led to the
   propagation of uncertain data and developing efficient clustering
   methods. In recent work several datamining methods model uncertain data
   object. In this work, the uncertain data object has been represented by
   probability distribution similarity function. Generally the problem of
   uncertain data objects according to probability distribution happens in
   many ways. First the probability distribution method for model uncertain
   data object then after that measure the similarity between data objects
   using distance metrics, then finally best clustering methods such as
   partition clustering, density based clustering. This study focus on
   partition based clustering methods. The survey discusses different
   methodologies to process and mine uncertain data in a diversity of

Title = {Significantly Fast and Robust Fuzzy C-Means Clustering Algorithm Based
   on Morphological Reconstruction and Membership Filtering},

Abstract = {As fuzzy c-means clustering (FCM) algorithm is sensitive to noise, local
   spatial information is often introduced to an objective function to
   improve the robustness of the FCM algorithm for image segmentation.
   However, the introduction of local spatial information often leads to a
   high computational complexity, arising out of an iterative calculation
   of the distance between pixels within local spatial neighbors and
   clustering centers. To address this issue, an improved FCM algorithm
   based on morphological reconstruction and membership filtering (FRFCM)
   that is significantly faster and more robust than FCM is proposed in
   this paper. First, the local spatial information of images is
   incorporated into FRFCM by introducing morphological reconstruction
   operation to guarantee noise-immunity and image detail-preservation.
   Second, the modification of membership partition, based on the distance
   between pixels within local spatial neighbors and clustering centers, is
   replaced by local membership filtering that depends only on the spatial
   neighbors of membership partition. Compared with state-of-the-art
   algorithms, the proposed FRFCM algorithm is simpler and significantly
   faster, since it is unnecessary to compute the distance between pixels
   within local spatial neighbors and clustering centers. In addition, it
   is efficient for noisy image segmentation because membership filtering
   are able to improve membership partition matrix efficiently. Experiments
   performed on synthetic and real-world images demonstrate that the
   proposed algorithm not only achieves better results, but also requires
   less time than the state-of-the-art algorithms for image segmentation.},

   characterized by densities and distances in grid subspace is firstly
   presented along with the automatically selecting of cluster centers.
   Then a rough self-learning theory including extensional learning and
   intensional learning is raised. To realize quick attribute reduction and
   self-learning, a novel rough set model named GCRS that integrates rough
   set theory and GSC algorithm is proposed, and a corresponding quick
   attribute reduction algorithm and a rough self-learning algorithm based
   on GCRS are subsequently designed. A multitude of experiments
   demonstrate three aspects: a) results of attribute reduction using GCRS
   model are proved to be of higher classification accuracies; b) attribute
   reduction based on GCRS model for big data manifests faster speed; c)
   results of rough self-learning experiments illustrate the validity of
   the proposed theory. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Trade-Off between Efficiency and Effectiveness: A Late Fusion Multi-View
   Clustering Algorithm},

Pages = {2709-2722},
Abstract = {Late fusion multi-view clustering (LFMVC) algorithms aim to integrate
   the base partition of each single view into a consensus partition. Base
   partitions can be obtained by performing kernel k-means clustering on
   all views. This type of method is not only computationally efficient,
   but also more accurate than multiple kernel k-means, and is thus widely
   used in the multi-view clustering context. LFMVC improves computational
   efficiency to the extent that the computational complexity of each
   iteration is reduced from O(n(3)) to O(n) (where n is the number of
   samples). However, LFMVC also limits the search space of the optimal
   solution, meaning that the clustering results obtained are not ideal.
   Accordingly, in order to obtain more information from each base
   partition and thus improve the clustering performance, we propose a new
   late fusion multi-view clustering algorithm with a computational
   complexity of O(n(2)). Experiments on several commonly used datasets
   demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can reach quickly convergence.
   Moreover, compared with other late fusion algorithms with computational
   complexity of O(n), the actual time consumption of the proposed
   algorithm does not significantly increase. At the same time, comparisons
   with several other state-of-the-art algorithms reveal that the proposed
   algorithm also obtains the best clustering performance.},

Abstract = {With the explosive growth of data, we have entered the era of big data.
   In order to sift through masses of information, many data mining
   algorithms using parallelization are being implemented. Cluster analysis
   occupies a pivotal position in data mining, and the DBSCAN algorithm is
   one of the most widely used algorithms for clustering. However, when the
   existing parallel DBSCAN algorithms create data partitions, the original
   database is usually divided into several disjoint partitions; with the
   increase in data dimension, the splitting and consolidation of
   high-dimensional space will consume a lot of time. To solve the problem,
   this paper proposes a parallel DBSCAN algorithm (S\_DBSCAN) based on
   Spark, which can quickly realize the partition of the original data and
   the combination of the clustering results. It is divided into the
   following steps: 1) partitioning the raw data based on a random sample,
   2) computing local DBSCAN algorithms in parallel, 3) merging the data
   partitions based on the centroid. Compared with the traditional DBSCAN
   algorithm, the experimental result shows the proposed S\_DBSCAN
   algorithm provides better operating efficiency and scalability.},

Abstract = {Clustering is a useful. exploratory tool for gene-expression data.
   Although successful applications of clustering techniques have been
   reported in the literature, there is no method of choice in the
   gene-expression analysis community. Moreover, there are only a few works
   that deal with the problem of automatically estimating the number of
   clusters in bioinformatics datasets. Most clustering methods require the
   number k of clusters to be either specified in advance or selected a
   posteriori from a set of clustering solutions over a range of k. In both
   cases, the user has to select the number of clusters. This paper
   proposes improvements to a clustering genetic algorithm that is capable
   of automatically discovering an optimal number of clusters and its
   corresponding optimal partition based upon numeric criteria. The
   proposed improvements are mainly designed to enhance the efficiency of
   the original clustering genetic algorithm, resulting in two new
   clustering genetic algorithms and an evolutionary algorithm for
   clustering (EAC). The original clustering genetic algorithm and its
   modified versions are evaluated in several runs using six
   gene-expression datasets in which the right clusters are known a priori.
   The results illustrate that all the proposed algorithms perform well in
   gene-expression data, although statistical comparisons in terms of the
   computational efficiency of each algorithm point out that EAC
   outperforms the others. Statistical evidence also shows that EAC is able
   to outperform a traditional method based on multiple runs of k-means
   over a range of k. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {K-Means clustering is a well-known partition-based technique in
   unsupervised learning to construct pattern models. The main difficulty,
   however, is that its performance is highly susceptible to the
   initialized partition. To attack this problem, a suboptimal K-Means
   algorithm is briefly reviewed by applying dynamic programming over the
   principal component direction. In particular, a heuristic clustering
   dissimilarity, the Delta-MSE function, is incorporated into the
   suboptimal K-Means algorithm. The Delta-MSE function is derived by
   calculating the difference of within-class variance before and after
   moving a given data sample from one cluster to another. Experimental
   results show that the suboptimal K-Means algorithm that uses the
   Delta-MSE dissimilarity generally outperforms the original L-2 distance
   based suboptimal algorithm and a specific kd-tree clustering algorithm.},

Title = {A Novel Hybrid PSO-K-Means Clustering Algorithm Using Gaussian
   Estimation of Distribution Method and Levy Flight},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Pages = {122848-122863},
Abstract = {Clustering is an important data analysis technique, which has been
   applied to many practical scenarios. However, many partitioning based
   clustering algorithms are sensitive to the initial state of cluster
   centroids, may get trapped in a local optimum, and have poor robustness.
   In recent years, particle swarm optimization (PSO) has been regarded as
   an effective solution to the problem. However, it has the possibility of
   converging to a local optimum, especially when solving complex problems.
   In this paper, we propose a hybrid PSO-K-means algorithm, which uses the
   Gaussian estimation of distribution method (GEDM) to assist PSO in
   updating the population information and adopts Levy flight to escape
   from the local optimum. The proposed algorithm is named a GEDM and Levy
   flight based PSO-K-means (GLPSOK) clustering algorithm. Firstly, during
   initialization, a few particles are initialized using the cluster
   centroids generated by K-means, while other particles are randomly
   initialized in the search space. Secondly, GEDM and PSO are selected
   with different probability to update the population information at
   different optimization stages. Thirdly, Levy flight is adopted to help
   the search escape from the local optimum. Finally, the greedy strategy
   is carried out to select the promising particles from the parents and
   the newly generated candidates. Experimental results on both synthetic
   data sets and real-world data sets show that the proposed algorithm can
   produce better clustering results and is more robust than existing
   classic or state-of-the-art clustering algorithms.},

Abstract = {The challenges of the standard clustering methods and the weaknesses of
   Apriori algorithm in frequent termset clustering formulate the goal of
   our research. Based on Association Rules mining, an efficient approach
   for Web Document Clustering (ARWDC) has been devised. An efficient
   Multi-Tire Hashing Frequent Termsets algorithm (MTHFT) has been used to
   improve the efficiency of mining association rules by targeting
   improvement in mining of frequent termset. Then, the documents are
   initially partitioned based on association rules. Since a document
   usually contains more than one frequent termset, the same document may
   appear in multiple initial partitions, i.e., initial partitions are
   overlapping. After making partitions disjoint, the documents are grouped
   within the partition using descriptive keywords, the resultant clusters
   are obtained effectively. In this paper, we have presented an extensive
   analysis of the ARWDC approach for different sizes of Reuter's datasets.
   Furthermore the performance of our approach is evaluated with the help
   of evaluation measures such as, Precision, Recall and F-measure compared
   to the existing clustering algorithms like Bisecting K-means and FIHC.
   The experimental results show that the efficiency, scalability and
   accuracy of the ARWDC approach has been improved significantly for
   Reuters datasets.},

Abstract = {The huge amount of information stored in databases owned by corporations
   (e.g., retail, financial, telecom) has spurred a tremendous interest in
   the area of knowledge discovery and data mining. Clustering, in data
   mining, is a useful technique for discovering interesting data
   distributions and patterns in the underlying data, and has many
   application fields, such as statistical data analysis, pattern
   recognition, image processing, and other business applications. Although
   researchers have been working on clustering algorithms for decades, and
   a lot of algorithms for clustering have been developed, there is still
   no efficient algorithm for clustering very large databases and high
   dimensional data. As an outstanding representative of clustering
   algorithms, DBSCAN algorithm shows good performance in spatial data
   clustering. However, for large spatial databases, DBSCAN requires large
   volume of memory support and could incur substantial I/O costs because
   it operates directly on the entire database. In this paper, several
   approaches are proposed to scale DBSCAN algorithm to large spatial
   databases. To begin with, a fast DBSCAN algorithm is developed, which
   considerably speeds up the original DBSCAN algorithm. Then a sampling
   based DBSCAN algorithm, a partitioning-based DBSCAN algorithm, and a
   parallel DBSCAN algorithm are introduced consecutively. Following that,
   based on the above-proposed algorithms, a synthetic algorithm is also
   given. Finally, some experimental results are given to demonstrate the
   effectiveness and efficiency of these algorithms.},

Abstract = {Advances in communication technologies have contributed to the
   proliferation of distributed datasets. The most effective approach to
   distributed learning is to learn locally and then combine the local
   models. In general, distributed algorithms assume that there is a single
   model that could be induced from the distributed datasets. Under this
   view, distribution is treated exclusively as a technical issue. However,
   real-world distributed datasets frequently present an intrinsic data
   skewness among their partitions. Despite of its importance, up to the
   authors' knowledge, its impact has been barely investigated in the
   literature. In this paper, the performance of different cluster-based
   distributed learning methods is analyzed over distinct scenarios by
   incrementing the differences in the probabilistic distribution of data
   among partitions. Based on these results the best approach is suggested
   at every scenario.},

Abstract = {Clustering naturally addresses many of the challenges of data streams
   and many data stream clustering algorithms (DSCAs) have been proposed.
   The literature does not, however, provide quantitative descriptions of
   how these algorithms behave in different circumstances. In this paper we
   study how the clusterings produced by different DSCAs change, relative
   to the ground truth, as quantitatively different types of concept drift
   are encountered. This paper makes two contributions to the literature.
   First, we propose a method for generating real-valued data streams with
   precise quantitative concept drift. Second, we conduct an experimental
   study to provide quantitative analyses of DSCA performance with
   synthetic real-valued data streams and show how to apply this knowledge
   to real world data streams. We find that large magnitude and short
   duration concept drifts are most challenging and that DSCAs with
   partitioning-based offline clustering methods are generally more robust
   than those with density-based offline clustering methods. Our results
   further indicate that increasing the number of classes present in a
   stream is a more challenging environment than decreasing the number of
   classes. Code related to this paper is available at:

Abstract = {Clustering is a crucial step in scientific data analysis and engineering
   systems. Thus, an efficient cluster analysis method often remains a key
   challenge. In this paper, we introduce a general purpose exemplar-based
   clustering method called (MEGA), which performs a novel message-passing
   strategy based on variational expectation-maximization and generalized
   arc-consistency techniques. Unlike message passing clustering methods,
   MEGA formulates the message-passing schema as E- and M-steps of
   variational expectation-maximization based on a reparameterized factor
   graph. It also exploits an adaptive variant of generalized arc
   consistency technique to perform a variational mean-field approximation
   in E-step to minimize a Kullback-Leibler divergence on the model
   evidence. Dissimilar to density-based clustering methods, MEGA has no
   sensitivity to initial parameters. In contrast to partition-based
   clustering methods, MEGA does not require pre-specifying the number of
   clusters. We focus on the binary-variable factor graph to model the
   clustering problem but MEGA is applicable to other graphical models in
   general. Our experiments on real-world problems demonstrate the
   efficiency of MEGA over existing prominent clustering algorithms such as
   Affinity propagation, Agglomerative, DBSCAN, K-means, and EM.},

Abstract = {Motivated by problems in data clustering, we establish general
   conditions under which families of nonparametric mixture models are
   identifiable by introducing a novel framework involving clustering
   overfitted parametric (i.e., misspecified) mixture models. These
   identifiability conditions generalize existing conditions in the
   literature and are flexible enough to include, for example, mixtures of
   infinite Gaussian mixtures. In contrast to the recent literature, we
   allow for general nonparametric mixture components and instead impose
   regularity assumptions on the underlying mixing measure. As our primary
   application we apply these results to partition-based clustering,
   generalizing the notion of a Bayes optimal partition from classical
   parametric model-based clustering to nonparametric settings.
   Furthermore, this framework is constructive, so that it yields a
   practical algorithm for learning identified mixtures, which is
   illustrated through several examples on real data. The key conceptual
   device in the analysis is the convex, metric geometry of probability
   measures on metric spaces and its connection to the Wasserstein
   convergence of mixing measures. The result is a flexible framework for
   nonparametric clustering with formal consistency guarantees.},

Abstract = {Clustering is to categorize data into groups or clusters such that the
   data in the same cluster are more similar to each other than to those in
   different clusters. The problem of clustering categorical data is to
   find a new partition in dataset to overcome the problem of clustering
   categorical data via cluster ensembles, result is observed that these
   techniques unluckily generate a final data partition based on incomplete
   information. The underlying ensemble-information matrix presents only
   cluster-data point relations, with many entries being left unknown. This
   problem degrades the quality of the clustering result. To improve
   clustering quality a new link-based approach the conventional matrix by
   discovering unknown entries through similarity between clusters in an
   ensemble and an efficient link-based algorithm is proposed for the
   underlying similarity assessment. In this paper propose C-Rank
   link-based algorithm improve clustering quality and ranking clusters in
   weighted networks. C-Rank consists of three major phases: (1)
   identification of candidate clusters; (2) ranking the candidates by
   integrated cohesion; and (3) elimination of non-maximal clusters. The
   finally apply this clustering result in graph partitioning technique is
   applied to a weighted bipartite graph that is formulated from the

Abstract = {Motivation: As the number of fully sequenced prokaryotic genomes
   continues to grow rapidly, computational methods for reliably detecting
   protein-coding regions become even more important. Audic and Claverie
   (1998) Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA, 95 10026-10031, have proposed a
   clustering algorithm for protein-coding regions in microbial genomes.
   The algorithm is based on three Markov models of order k associated with
   subsequences extracted front a given genome. The parameters of the three
   Markov models are recursively updated by the algorithm which, in
   simulations, always appear to converge to a unique stable partition of
   the genome. The partition corresponds to three kinds of regions: (1)
   coding on the direct strand, (2) coding on the complementary strand, (3)
   non-coding.
   Results: Here we provide an explanation for the convergence of the
   algorithm by observing that it is essentially a form of the expectation
   maximization (EM) algorithm applied to the corresponding mixture model.
   We also provide a partial justification for the uniqueness of the
   partition based on identifiability. Other possible variations and
   improvements are briefly discussed.},

Abstract = {This paper presents an optimal fuzzy partition based Takagi Sugeno Fuzzy
   Model (TSFM) in which a novel clustering algorithm, known as Modified
   Fuzzy C-Regression Model (MFCRM), has been proposed. The objective
   function of MFCRM algorithm has been developed by considering of
   geometrical structure of input data and linear functional relation
   between input-output data. The MFCRM partitions the data space to create
   fuzzy subspaces (rules). A new validation criterion has been developed
   for detecting the right number of rules (subspaces) in a given data set.
   The obtained fuzzy partition is used to build the fuzzy structure and
   identify the premise parameters. Once, right number of rules and premise
   parameters have been identified, then consequent parameters have been
   identified by orthogonal least square (OLS) approach. The cluster
   validation index has been tested on synthetic data set. The
   effectiveness of MFCRM based TSFM has been validated on benchmark
   examples, such as Boiler Turbine system, Mackey-Glass time series data
   and Box-Jenkins model. The model performance is also validated through
   high-dimensional data such as Auto-MPG data and Boston Housing data. (C)

Abstract = {An increasing number of applications require to recognize the class of
   an incoming time series as quickly as possible without unduly
   compromising the accuracy of the prediction. In this paper, we put
   forward a new optimization criterion which takes into account both the
   cost of misclassification and the cost of delaying the decision. Based
   on this optimization criterion, we derived a family of non-myopic
   algorithms which try to anticipate the expected future gain in
   information in balance with the cost of waiting. In one class of
   algorithms, unsupervised-based, the expectations use the clustering of
   time series, while in a second class, supervised-based, time series are
   grouped according to the confidence level of the classifier used to
   label them. Extensive experiments carried out on real datasets using a
   large range of delay cost functions show that the presented algorithms
   are able to solve the earliness vs. accuracy trade-off, with the
   supervised partition based approaches faring better than the
   unsupervised partition based ones. In addition, all these methods
   perform better in a wide variety of conditions than a state of the art
   method based on a myopic strategy which is recognized as being very
   competitive. Furthermore, our experiments show that the non-myopic
   feature of the proposed approaches explains in large part the obtained
   performances.},

Volume = {632},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Semi-supervised clustering (SSC), a technique integrating
   semi-supervised learning and clustering analysis, incorporates the given
   prior information (e.g., class labels and pairwise constraints) into
   clustering to guide the clustering process and improve the performance.
   In recent years, a large number of valuable works have emerged, focusing
   on theoretical research and application in different fields. In this
   paper, a detailed review of SSC is provided from a new perspective.
   Firstly, all SSC studies are organized as partition-based SSC,
   hierarchical-based SSC, density-based SSC, graph-based SSC, neural
   network-based SSC, Nonnegative Matrix Factorization-based SSC and random
   subspace technique-based SSC. Thus, the semi-supervised researches can
   be in-depth discussed in each clustering idea. Secondly, the general
   overviews are detailed in each category respectively, including the
   performance, the suitable scenarios and the way to add supervising
   information. Thirdly, the recent successful applications of SSC are
   summarized according to different backgrounds such as medical,
   biological, business, journalism, financial and so on. Based on this,
   some application caveats and development trends of SSC are particularly
   given in the end. This comprehensive review and analysis of SSC can
   provide an overall outline, the scope of research topics, and a relative
   complete analysis of existing SSC methods for researchers.},

Abstract = {Number of connected devices is steadily increasing and this trend is
   expected to continue in the near future. Connected devices continuously
   generate data streams and the data streams may often be high dimensional
   and contain concept drift. Clustering is one of the most suitable
   methods for real-time data stream processing, since clustering can be
   applied with less prior information about the data. Also, data embedding
   makes the visualization of high dimensional data possible and may
   simplify clustering process. There exist several data stream clustering
   algorithms in the literature; however, no data stream embedding method
   exists. Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) is a data
   embedding algorithm that is suitable to be applied on stationary
   (stable) data streams, though it cannot adapt concept drift. In this
   study, we describe a novel method EmCStream, to apply UMAP on evolving
   (nonstationary) data streams, to detect and adapt concept drift and to
   cluster embedded data instances using a distance or partitioning-based
   clustering algorithm. We have evaluated EmCStream against the
   state-of-the-art stream clustering algorithms using both synthetic and
   real data streams containing concept drift. EmCStream outperforms
   DenStream and CluStream, in terms of clustering quality, on both
   synthetic and real evolving data streams.},

Abstract = {In this paper, a data partitioning method was built and applied to a
   model of semantic-based image retrieval. An improvement of data
   partitioning based on the hierarchical structure is proposed in which
   data regions were created to store images; called the growth partition
   tree (GP-Tree). Based on this, the neighbor cluster graph was built in
   order to increase the performance of retrieving similar images. The k-NN
   algorithm was applied to classify an input query image; then, a SPARQL
   statement structure was generated and executed on the ontology to
   extract the semantics of an input image as well as the semantics of the
   image class. From there, the semantic-based image retrieval model was
   proposed and experimented on the image datasets ImageCLEF, and Stanford
   Dogs. The experimental results evaluated and compared with the recently
   published works on the same datasets and demonstrate that the proposed
   method improves the retrieval accuracy and efficiency.},

Abstract = {Antepartum cardiotocography (CTG) monitoring is a crucial screening tool
   widely utilized to evaluate fetal wellbeing. However, the complexity and
   non-linearity of CTG usually result in inter-observer and intra-observer
   variability in a visual CTG interpretation using clinical guidelines. In
   this paper, a fuzzy C-means clustering based adaptive neuro-fuzzy
   inference system (FCM-ANFIS) was proposed to automatically classify CTG
   for antenatal fetal monitoring. Data visualization and spearman
   correlation analysis were implemented to select CTG features. Then, the
   fuzzy space was partitioned by using fuzzy C-means clustering algorithm,
   and the adjustment parameters were adjusted through the self-learning
   mechanism of neural networks and least squares algorithm. The
   experimental results show that the fuzzy space partition based on FCM
   clustering could improve the performance of ANFIS, and the proposed
   FCM-ANFIS model outperforms the state-of-the-art automatic
   classification of CTG models. In conclusion, the proposed FCM-ANIFIS
   model has promising learning ability and adaptability for the complexity
   and uncertainty of antenatal CTG interpretation.},

Abstract = {Optimal location problems are important problems and are particularly
   useful for strategic planning of resources. However, existing studies
   mainly focus on computing one or k optimal locations. We study the Group
   OptimAl Location (GOAL) problem, which computes a minimum set of
   locations such that establishing facilities at these locations
   guarantees that every facility user can access at least one facility
   within a given distance r is an element of R. We propose two algorithms,
   GOAL-Greedy and GOAL-DP, to first solve the problem in the Euclidean
   space. These two algorithms are supported by a clustering-based method
   to compute an initial solution of the problem, which yields an upper
   bound of the number of locations needed to solve the problem. We propose
   a grid partitioning-based strategy to refine the initial solution and
   obtain the final solution. We further extend our algorithms to road
   networks. We perform extensive experiments on the proposed algorithms.
   The results show that the proposed algorithms can solve the problem
   effectively and efficiently in both Euclidean spaces and road networks.},

Abstract = {Real-time systems are nowadays extensively used in most time-critical
   embedded applications. The existing multiprocessor real-time scheduling
   algorithms are based on partitioned and global scheduling approaches.
   The partitioned-based algorithms suffer poor utilization bound, load
   balancing, not compatible for an open system environment, and the global
   scheduling approach faces problems like high scheduling, migration
   overhead. Cluster scheduling represents a hybrid scheduling approach
   which consists of a set of processors as clusters and tasks scheduled to
   each processor of clusters using a global scheduling approach. The
   different cluster formation heuristics are investigated for homogenous
   clusters. The main objective of this article is to propose task
   utilization-based cluster formation and harmonic period aware task
   allocation for a hierarchical real-time system on a multiprocessor
   platform. Tasks with high utilization, cluster size tune to a smaller
   value to achieve high utilization. Tasks with low utilization, the size
   of cluster tune to larger to reduce migration and scheduling overheads.
   Experimentation performed on multiprocessor real-time simulator with a
   different set of tasks, multiprocessor system, different tasks
   utilization, and cluster size. Simulation results show that cluster base
   approach increases the number of tasks scheduled on a multiprocessor
   system, system utilization, and reduces response time, migration, and
   preemption overheads.},

Abstract = {In many scientific, engineering or multimedia applications, complex
   distance functions are used to measure similarity accurately.
   Furthermore, there often exist simpler lower-bounding distance
   functions, which can be computed much more efficiently. In this paper,
   we will show how these simple distance functions can be used to
   parallelize the density-based clustering algorithm DBSCAN. First, the
   data is partitioned based on an enumeration calculated by the
   hierarchical clustering algorithm OPTICS, so that similar objects have
   adjacent enumeration values. We use the fact that clustering based on
   lower-bounding distance values conservatively approximates the exact
   clustering. By integrating the multi-step query processing paradigm
   directly into the clustering algorithms, the clustering on the slaves
   can be carried out very efficiently. Finally, we show that the different
   result sets computed by the various slaves can effectively and
   efficiently be merged to a global result by means of cluster
   connectivity graphs. In an experimental evaluation based on real-world
   test data sets, we demonstrate the benefits of our approach.},

Abstract = {Widespread use of stochastic flow based graph clustering algorithms, e.
   g. Markov Clustering (MCL), has been hampered by their lack of
   scalability and fragmentation of output. Multi-Level Regularized Markov
   Clustering (MLRMCL) is an improvement over Markov Clustering (MCL),
   providing faster performance and better quality of clusters for large
   graphs. However, a closer look at MLR-MCL's performance reveals
   potential for further improvement. In this paper we present a fast
   parallel implementation of MLR-MCL algorithm via static work
   partitioning based on analysis of memory footprints. By parallelizing
   the most time consuming region of the sequential MLR-MCL algorithm, we
   report up to 10.43x (5.22x in average) speedup on CPU, using 8 datasets
   from SNAP and 3 PPI datasets. In addition, our algorithm can be adapted
   to perform general sparse matrix-matrix multiplication (SpGEMM), and our
   experimental evaluation shows up to 3.50x (1.92x in average) speedup on
   CPU, and up to 5.12x (2.20x in average) speedup on MIC, comparing to the
   SpGEMM kernel provided by Intel Math Kernel Library (MKL).},

Abstract = {A geotagged photo refers to that a photo contains its location
   information where it was taken. Compared with other existing
   applications, we show the photo clusters instead of all photos where the
   number of photo clusters is much less than that of all photos. We
   designed a clustering algorithm that clusters geotagged photos
   (abbreviated as GPCA) in accordance to thresholds of different scales.
   In general, GPCA is an alternative of k-means clustering algorithm.
   Given a scale graduation of a map, the distance threshold is also
   determined Before clustering geotagged photos, we use the distance
   threshold to decide the number of clusters. In other words, the number
   of centriods is chosen according to the graduation scale of a map. GPCA
   clusters geotagged photos into different photo clusters. Then, GPCA
   recomputed the new centeriods of photo clusters. GPCA executes the
   computation of new centeriods iteratively until all centeriods are fixed
   Note that prior partition-based clustering algorithms choose an
   arbitrary number of initial centriods at random. Also, choosing the
   number of centriods is considered as an application-dependent issue. As
   a result, they did not guarantee that the clustering quality is not the
   same every time. By taking advantage of the result of using photo
   clusters, the performance of map-enabled photo service is improved
   efficiently.},

Abstract = {Affinity propagation (AP) is a clustering algorithm which has much
   better performance than traditional clustering approach such as k-means
   algorithm. In this paper, we present an algorithm called voting
   partition affinity propagation (voting-PAP) which is a method for
   clustering using evidence accumulation based on AP. Resulting clusters
   by voting-PAP are not constrained to be hyper-spherically shaped
   Voting-PAP consists of three parts: Partition Affinity propagation
   (PAP), relaxed multi-root minimum spanning tree (MST) and majority
   voting. PAP is a method which can produce different exemplar set based
   on AP. Relaxed multi-root MST is a data point assign algorithm which has
   better performance than nearest assign rule. Majority voting is a scheme
   used to find a consistent clustering result of different partitions
   based on the idea of evidence accumulation. We also discuss how to find
   an appropriate threshold corresponding to at? approximate ideal
   consistent partition in this paper.},

Abstract = {In many clustering applications, the user has some vague notion of the
   number and membership of the desired clusters. However, it is difficult
   for the user to provide such knowledge explicitly in the clustering
   process. We propose a solution to circumvent this difficulty by
   introducing a feedback mechanism. The notion of Bayesian inference for
   relevance feedback in content-based image retrieval is modified for data
   clustering. Given the number of clusters, the proposed algorithm seeks
   information about the target partition by asking the user a sequence of
   queries about whether a pair of objects should be put in the same
   cluster or not. Information-theoretic criteria is adopted to select the
   queries to be presented to the user The assumption made here is that
   cluster labels are ``smooth{''}, i.e., similar objects should share the
   same cluster labels. We show that it is possible to obtain reasonable
   partitions based on the user feedback alone, without the need of
   specifying a clustering objective function.},

Abstract = {As a partition based clustering algorithm, K-Means is widely used in
   many areas for the features of its efficiency and easily understood.
   However, it is well known that the K-Means algorithm may get suboptimal
   solutions, depending on the choice of the initial cluster centers. In
   this paper, we propose a projection-based K-Means initialization
   algorithm. The proposed algorithm first employ conventional Gaussian
   kernel density estimation method to find the highly density data areas
   in one dimension. Then the projection step is to iteratively use density
   estimation from the lower variance dimensions to the higher variance
   ones until all the dimensions are computed. Experiments on actual
   datasets show that our method can get similar results compared with
   other conventional methods with fewer computation tasks.},

Title = {Identification of flow regimes in boiling flow with clustering
   algorithms: An interpretable machine-learning perspective},
Journal = {APPLIED THERMAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {228},
Month = {JUN 25},
Abstract = {The flow regime is the prerequisite to accurately modeling two-phase
   flow. Unsupervised machine learning techniques enable the identification
   of flow regimes objectively. Previous machine learning models are used
   as a ``black box{''} tool without knowing the physical phenomena in the
   flow regime. Consequently, the cause of the identification error tends
   to be poorly understood and the model cannot be fundamentally improved.
   The paper develops an approach to better understand the identification
   result by creating a mapping relation between bubble distribution and
   the components in machine learning algorithms. The intrinsic
   interpretation generates the clustering principle to guide the feed-in
   feature extraction and clustering algorithm selection processes. Four
   features extracted from the bubble-size raw data recorded using
   conductivity probes are examined. Among them, the Cumulative
   Distribution Function of the chord length in seven dimensions is
   demonstrated to be the appropriate feed-in feature. Three major kinds of
   clustering algorithms are investigated, including partition-based,
   hierarchy-based, and model-based methods. After assigning physical
   meanings to the nodes in the algo-rithm and inspecting the clustering
   outcomes, the K-means, K-medoids, and Self-Organizing Maps are shown to
   succeed in the flow-regime identification problem. In addition, the
   local and the global flow regimes are generated by the well-designed
   machine learning model to assist the understanding of the boiling flow
   structure in a multi-dimensional way and in an area-averaged sense. The
   overall accuracy of the machine learning model for the three global flow
   regimes is 86\%, which suggests the chosen algorithm with the selected
   feed-in feature is capable to capture the flow regime in the boiling
   flow. The flow regime map for the boiling dataset is compared with the
   existing flow regime criteria developed in the air-water flow, the
   result of which highlights the necessity of a new criterion to capture
   the transition from bubbly to slug for boiling flow. For the range of
   flow conditions considered in this work, the transition criterion
   between bubbly and slug flows is proposed to be 0.14 for upward boiling
   flow in an annular channel.},

Title = {Multidimensional grid-based clustering with local differential privacy},
Journal = {INFORMATION SCIENCES},

Abstract = {Privacy-preserving clustering has received increasing research attention
   in recent years. Local differential privacy (LDP) is a privacy model
   without relying on trusted third parties. It plays a crucial role in
   distributed privacy-preserving clustering. Most previous methods focus
   on partition-based clustering (e.g., k-means), which necessitates many
   iterative interactions. Massive iterations cause a division of the
   privacy budget and increase the amount of individual noise, affecting
   the clustering utility. To address this issue, we turn to grid-based
   clustering and design the GC-LDP algorithm to balance the privacy and
   clus-tering utility with only three rounds of interactions. In GC-LDP,
   our core contribution is to develop a non-uniform grid division method
   via the coefficient of variation (CV), which can generate a grid
   structure approximating the global data distribution within two rounds
   of interactions. Besides, we designed a new perturbation mechanism to
   reduce the amount of individual noise injection. Further, a cell
   aggregation method is developed by exploring the relative density
   difference among grids to achieve multi-density clustering. Theoretical
   analysis and experiments on real-world datasets show that GC-LDP can
   obtain high-quality clustering results while satisfying local
   differential privacy. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Information is for the most part found inside databases of some kind.
   Coordinating these information would give advantages to the associations
   that claim these information. RDF is a general recommendation dialect
   for the Web, binding together information from different sources.
   SPARQL, a query language for RDF, can join information from various
   databases. Querying a huge RDF informational collection is to a great
   degree time consuming. Submitting a SPARQL query to a more promising
   subgraph will increase speed and reduce search space. For this, RDF
   summarization is done. Existing systems either use graph-based
   techniques for summarizing RDF or divide RDF triples simply based on its
   elements. RDF though possessing a graph like structure, cannot be
   expected to have every features of graph structure. And simple
   partitioning based on triple elements is also inefficient. In this
   paper, RDF dataset is first partitioned based on predicate similarity.
   These partitions are clustered based on semantic relatedness between
   predicates, so that more similar triples come in a single cluster. The
   RDF cluster graphs thus obtained are stored in Jena Tuple DataBase(TDB)
   as named graphs. SPARQL querying, is done on this named graph
   collection. A list of models that the SPARQL query require is obtained
   from index and querying is done on this union of graphs. The proposed
   algorithm is faster as search space is reduced and is also scalable.},

Abstract = {While most of the clustering procedures are aimed to construct an
   optimal partition of objects or, sometimes, of variables, there are
   other methods, called block clustering methods, which consider
   simultaneously the two sets and organize the data into homogeneous
   blocks. Recently, we have proposed a new mixture model called block
   mixture model which takes into account this situation. This model allows
   to embed simultaneous clustering of objects and variables in a mixture
   approach. We have considered this probabilistic model under the
   classification likelihood approach and we have developed a new algorithm
   for simultaneous partitioning based on the Classification EM algorithm.
   In this paper, we consider the block clustering problem under the
   maximum likelihood approach and the goal of our contribution is to
   estimate the parameters of this model. To reach this aim, we use an
   approximation of the likelihood and we propose an
   alternated-optimization algorithm to estimate the parameters, and to
   illustrate our approach, we study the case of binary data.},

Abstract = {Graph partitioning methods in data mining have been widely used to
   discover protein complexes in protein-protein interaction (PPI) network.
   However, PPI networks with attributes need more effective attribute
   graph partitioning methods. Attribute graph partitioning aims to obtain
   high quality partitions satisfying the requirement: nodes in the same
   partition not only connect to each other more densely but also share
   more similar attribute values. In this paper, we propose a novel method
   for attributed graph partitioning based on fuzzy clustering. This method
   firstly devises a unified similarity measure using SimRank to construct
   the fuzzy similarity matrix of the attributed graph and can integrate
   structural and attribute similarities of nodes into a flexible weighted
   framework. Then it deduces the corresponding fuzzy equivalent matrix
   using fuzzy set theory. Finally, the result of partitioning can be
   obtained using fuzzy clustering algorithm. We conduct some experiments
   on several typical attributed graphs, which can also simulate PPI
   networks with attributes. The results show that our method is very
   effective to identify high quality partitions of attributed graphs and
   even performs better than some representative methods.},

Abstract = {Among various types of clustering methods, partition-based methods such
   as k-means and FCM are widely used in the analysis of such data.
   However, when duration between stimuli is different, such methods are
   not able to provide satisfactory results because they find equal size
   clusters according to the fundamental running principle of these
   methods. In such cases, neighborhood-based clustering methods can give
   more satisfactory results because measurement series are separated from
   one another according to dramatic breaking points. In recent years,
   bispectral index (BIS) monitoring, which is used for monitoring the
   level of anesthesia, has been used in sleep studies. Sleep stages are
   classically scored according to the Rechtschaffen and Kales (R\&K)
   scoring system. BIS has been shown to have a strong correlation with the
   R\&K scoring system. In this study, fuzzy neighborhood/density-based
   spatial clustering of applications with noise (FN-DBSCAN) that combines
   speed of the DBSCAN algorithm and robustness of the NRFJP algorithm is
   applied to BIS measurement series. As a result of experiments, we can
   conclude that, by using BIS data, the FN-DBSCAN method estimates sleep
   stages better than the fuzzy c-means method.},

Abstract = {Traditionally, the geospatial regionalization task consists of
   aggregating into regions, geographically connected areas that share
   similar characteristics. Although various spatial optimization
   approaches have been proposed for finding exact regionalization
   solutions, these approaches are not practical when applied to a large
   number of areas or problems for online aggregation, due to the long
   execution times using hardware with low resources. In this article, we
   present a framework for executing spatial regionalization tasks. The
   pre-condition for using our framework is the definition of a map
   describing the neighborhood relations-as spatial contiguity
   constraints-among the areas (or objects) to be regionalized. In our
   framework we implemented three clustering algorithms with spatial
   contiguity constraints: RegK-Means and Agglomerative Hierarchical
   Regionalization (AHR), our adaptation of k-means partition-based
   clustering and hierarchical-based clustering algorithms, respectively;
   and the Automatic Zoning Procedure (AZP), a traditional algorithm for
   regionalization that also has the premise of simplifying the
   neighborhood relation representation. We conducted an exploratory
   analysis composed of two different experiments. Our results showed that
   our framework leads to a faster way of executing regionalization tasks
   in the experimental analysis, allowing us to observe a significant gain
   of AHR and RegK-Means over AZP in execution time, while showing better
   or similar results in other metrics, such as figure of merit.},

Abstract = {Although many clustering procedures aim to construct an optimal
   partition of objects or, sometimes, of variables, there are other
   methods, called block clustering methods, which consider simultaneously
   the two sets and organize the data into homogeneous blocks. Recently, we
   have proposed a new mixture model called block mixture model which takes
   into account this situation. This model allows one to embed simultaneous
   clustering of objects and variables in a mixture approach. We have
   studied this probabilistic model under the classification likelihood
   approach and developed a new algorithm for simultaneous partitioning
   based on the Classification EM algorithm. In this paper, we consider the
   block clustering problem under the maximum likelihood approach and the
   goal of our contribution is to estimate the parameters of this model.
   Unfortunately, the application of the EM algorithm for the block mixture
   model cannot be made directly; difficulties arise due to the dependence
   structure in the model and approximations are required. Using a
   variational approximation, we propose a generalized EM algorithm to
   estimate the parameters of the block mixture model and, to illustrate
   our approach, we study the case of binary data by using a Bernoulli
   block mixture.},

Abstract = {Real world datasets are commonly large and involve a lot of features.
   This is due because of the variety of domains where are obtained from or

   in this paper a new weighting partitions-based features selection
   framework is proposed in conjunction with clustering ensemble for large

   biological domains are chosen to be evaluated and an average accuracy
   between 75.18\% and 98.04\% is achieved. Results show that the new

Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2021},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) has been widely
   adopted in underwater acoustic (UWA) communication due to its good
   anti-multipath performance and high spectral efficiency. For UWA-OFDM
   systems, channel state information (CSI) is essential for channel
   equalization and adaptive transmission, which can significantly affect
   the reliability and throughput. However, the time-varying UWA channel is
   difficult to estimate because of excessive delay spread and complex
   noise distribution. To this end, a novel Bayesian learning-based channel
   estimation architecture is proposed for UWA-OFDM systems. A
   clustered-sparse channel distribution model and a noise-resistant
   channel measurement model are constructed, and the model hyperparameters
   are iteratively optimized to obtain accurate Bayesian channel
   estimation. Accordingly, to obtain the clustered-sparse distribution, a
   partition-based clustered-sparse Bayesian learning (PB-CSBL) algorithm
   was designed. In order to lessen the effect of strong colored noise, a
   noise-corrected clustered-sparse channel estimation (NC-CSCE) algorithm
   was proposed to improve the estimation accuracy. Numerical simulations
   and lake trials are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the
   algorithms. Results show that the proposed algorithms achieve higher
   channel estimation accuracy and lower bit error rate (BER).},

Abstract = {In an extended targets tracking, especially in clutter environment with
   unknown and varying number of targets, measurement partition is of great
   importance for accurate filtering. But it is always computational and
   complicated in many cases. To solve this problem, a new measurement set
   partitioning based on CFSFDP algorithm is proposed. Firstly, the Local
   Outlier Factor is used to reduce the clutter, then a new method based on
   density peaks in <Science> is used to partition the measurement set.
   This algorithm is not sensitive to the shape and can realize accuracy
   measurement set partitioning for any shape of targets. Simulation
   results show that in the case of target crossover, the proposed
   algorithm can ensure the performance of the extended target tracking ,
   as well as reduce the computational time effectively.},

Abstract = {Multi-view clustering (MVC) optimally integrates complementary
   information from different views to improve clustering performance.
   Although demonstrating promising performance in many applications, we
   observe that most of existing methods directly combine multiple views to
   learn an optimal similarity for clustering. These methods would cause
   intensive computational complexity and over-complicated optimization. In
   this paper, we theoretically uncover the connection between existing
   k-means clustering and the alignment between base partitions and
   consensus partition. Based on this observation, we propose a simple but
   effective multi-view algorithm termed Multi-view Clustering via Late
   Fusion Alignment Maximization (MVC-LFA). In specific, MVC-LFA proposes
   to maximally align the consensus partition with the weighted base
   partitions. Such a criterion is beneficial to significantly reduce the
   computational complexity and simplify the optimization procedure.
   Furthermore, we design a three-step iterative algorithm to solve the new
   resultant optimization problem with theoretically guaranteed
   convergence. Extensive experiments on five multi-view benchmark datasets
   demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed MVC-LFA.},

Abstract = {In comparing clustering partitions, the Rand index (RI) and the adjusted
   Rand index (ARI) are commonly used for measuring the agreement between
   partitions. Such external validation indexes can be used to quantify how
   close the clusters are to a reference partition (or to prior knowledge
   about the data) by counting classified pairs of elements. To evaluate
   the solution of a fuzzy clustering algorithm, several extensions of the
   Rand index and other similarity measures to fuzzy partitions have been
   proposed. An extension of the ARI for fuzzy partitions based on
   thenormalized degree of concordanceis proposed. The performance of the
   proposed index is evaluated through Monte Carlo simulation studies.},

Abstract = {Hierarchical clustering methods have attracted much attention by giving
   the user a maximum amount of flexibility. Rather than requiring
   parameter choices to be predetermined, the result represents all
   possible levels of granularity. In this paper a hierarchical method is
   introduced that is fundamentally related to partitioning methods, such
   as k-medoids and k-means, as well as to a density based method, namely
   center-defined DENCLUE. It is superior to both k-means and k-medoids in
   its reduction of outlier influence. Nevertheless it avoids both the time
   complexity of some partition-based algorithms and the storage
   requirements of density-based ones. An implementation is presented that
   is particularly suited to spatial-, stream-, and multimedia data, using
   P-trees(1) for efficient data storage and access.},

Abstract = {This paper proposes a cluster validation procedure allowing to obtain
   the optimal number of clusters on a set of fuzzy partitions. Such a
   procedure is established considering fuzzy classification systems
   endowed with a dissimilarity function that, in turn, generates a
   dissimilarity matrix. Establishing a dissimilarity matrix for the case
   of a crisp partition, we propose an optimization problem comparing the
   characteristic polynomials of the fuzzy partition and crisp partition.
   Based on the above, we propose a definition for the optimal number of
   fuzzy classes in a fuzzy partition. Our approach is illustrated through
   an example on image analysis by the fuzzy c-means algorithm.},

Abstract = {Membrane computing is widely used in many areas, however, there are
   several limitations in its structures and rules. Although many
   researchers are engaged in the study of P systems, seldom focus on
   improving membrane structures. The purpose of this paper is to propose a
   new kind of communication P system on lattice (LTC-P systems). We
   describe membrane structures on lattice with communication rules. The
   computational completeness of the new P system is proved by simulation
   of register machine. The new P system is used in solving clustering
   problems. It is combined with the thought of density-based,
   partition-based and hierarchical clustering algorithm. Clustering is
   implemented by supremum and infimum rules. The result is obtained
   through output membrane. All the processes are conducted in membranes.
   Cluster result via a points data set verifies that the proposed new P
   systems cluster data set accurately and reduce time complexity. Wine
   data set are also used in testing the influence of parameters. More
   suitable and are found to gain less missing data which are seen as
   noise. Comparative results in various aspects indicate LTC-P system
   based clustering algorithm consumes less time than traditional
   algorithms significantly. It also uses less rules and gives more simple
   membrane structures than conventional cell-like P system. The new P
   system provides an alternative for traditional membrane computing.},

Abstract = {Anonymization is a practical solution for preserving user's identity
   privacy before data publishing. There are various anonymity techniques
   can be applied to maintain data utility of micro-data and social
   networks, however these methods lead to a high runtime or low anonymous
   graph utility. In this article, an efficient, utility-preserving
   approach has been proposed to reduce anonymization runtime as well as
   the amount of information loss incurred by graph anonymization. We craft
   our anonymization algorithm by combining greedy partition-based
   aggregating with multi-dimensional sorting as main heuristic tools. The
   proposed algorithm generates a partial order of the vertices so that the
   vertex at top rank and another vertex at bottom rank can never be
   aggregated in the same group, the runtime is reduced. Greedy
   partition-based aggregating is employed to create k-anonymous clusters
   which minimizing information loss. Experimental results on real-world
   datasets show the proposed method has good performance and is superior
   to the existing methods.},

Title = {Extracting elite pairwise constraints for clustering},
Journal = {NEUROCOMPUTING},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {99},
Pages = {124-133},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Semi-supervised clustering under pairwise constraints (i.e. must-links
   and cannot-links) has been a hot topic in the data mining community in
   recent years. Since pairwise constraints provided by distinct domain
   experts may conflict with each other, a lot of research work has been
   conducted to evaluate the effects of noise imposing on semi-supervised
   clustering. In this paper, we introduce elite pairwise constraints,
   including elite must-link (EML) and elite cannot-link (ECL) constraints.
   In contrast to traditional constraints, both EML and ECL constraints are
   required to be satisfied in every optimal partition (i.e. a partition
   with the minimum criterion function). Therefore, no conflict will be
   caused by those new constraints. First, we prove that it is NP-hard to
   obtain EML or ECL constraints. Then, a heuristic method named Limit
   Crossing is proposed to achieve a fraction of those new constraints. In
   practice, this new method can always retrieve a lot of EML or ECL
   constraints. To evaluate the effectiveness of Limit Crossing,
   multi-partition based and distance based methods are also proposed in
   this paper to generate faux elite pairwise constraints. Extensive
   experiments have been conducted on both UCI and synthetic data sets
   using a semi-supervised clustering algorithm named COP-KMedoids.
   Experimental results demonstrate that COP-KMedoids under EML and ECL
   constraints generated by Limit Crossing can outperform those under
   either faux constraints or no constraints. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {Document clustering is related to data clustering concept which is one
   of data mining tasks and unsupervised classification. It is often
   applied to the huge data in order to make a partition based on their
   similarity. Initially, it used for Information Retrieval in order to
   improve the precision and recall from query. It is very easy to cluster
   with small data attributes which contains of important items.
   Furthermore, document clustering is very useful in retrieve information
   application in order to reduce the consuming time and get high precision
   and recall. Therefore, we propose to integrate the information retrieval
   method and document clustering as concept space approach. The method is
   known as Latent Semantic Index (LSI) approach which used Singular Vector
   Decomposition (SVD) or Principle Component Analysis (PCA). The aim of
   this method is to reduce the matrix dimension by finding the pattern in
   document collection with refers to concurrent of the terms. Each method
   is implemented to weight of term-document in vector space model (VSM)
   for document clustering using fuzzy c-means algorithm. Besides reduction
   of term-document matrix, this research also uses the cosine similarity
   measurement as replacement of Euclidean distance to involve in fuzzy
   c-means. And as a result, the performance of the proposed method is
   better than the existing method with f-measure around 0.91 and entropy
   around 0.51.},

Abstract = {Hard and fuzzy clustering algorithms are part of the partition-based
   clustering family. They are widely used in real-world applications to
   cluster numerical and categorical data. While in hard clustering an
   object is assigned to a cluster with certainty, in fuzzy clustering an
   object can be assigned to different clusters given a membership degree.
   For both types of method an entropy can be incorporated into the
   objective function, mostly to avoid solutions raising too much
   uncertainties. In this paper, we present an extension of a fuzzy
   clustering method for categorical data using fuzzy centroids. The new
   algorithm, referred to as Categorical Fuzzy Entropy (CFE), integrates an
   entropy term in the objective function. This allows a better
   fuzzification of the cluster prototypes. Experiments on ten real-world
   data sets and statistical comparisons show that the new method can
   efficiently handle categorical data.},

Abstract = {Fusion of image segmentations using consensus clustering and based on
   the optimization of a single criterion (commonly called the median
   partition based approach) may bias and limit the performance of an image
   segmentation model. To address this issue, we propose, in this paper, a
   new fusion model of image segmentation based on multi-objective
   optimization which aims to avoid the bias caused by a single criterion
   and to achieve a final improved segmentation. The proposed fusion model
   combines two conflicting and complementary segmentation criteria,
   namely; the region-based variation of information (VoI) criterion and
   the contour-based F-Measure (precision-recall) criterion with an
   entropy-based confidence weighting factor. To optimize our energy-based
   model we use an optimization procedure derived from the iterative
   conditional modes (ICM) algorithm. The experimental results on the
   Berkeley database with manual ground truth segmentations clearly show
   the effectiveness and the robustness of our multi-objective median
   partition based approach.},

Abstract = {k-means clustering method is an iterative partition-based method which
   for finite data-sets converges to a solution in a finite time. The
   running time of this method grows linearly with respect to the size of
   the data-set. Many variants have been proposed to speed-up the
   conventional k-means clustering method. In this paper, we propose a
   prototype-based hybrid approach to speed-up the k-means clustering
   method. The proposed method, first partitions the data-set into small
   clusters (grouplets), which are of varying sizes. Each grouplet is
   represented by a prototype. Later, the set of prototypes is partitioned
   into k clusters using the modified k-means method. The modified k-means
   clustering method is similar to the conventional k-means method but it
   avoids empty clusters (the clusters to which no pattern is assigned) in
   the iterative process. In each cluster of prototypes, each prototype is
   replaced by its corresponding set of patterns (which formed the
   grouplet) to derive a partition of the data-set. Since this partition of
   the data-set can deviate from the partition obtained using the
   conventional k-means method over the entire data-set, a correcting step
   is proposed. Both theoretically and experimentally, the conventional
   k-means method and the proposed hybrid method (augmented with the
   correcting step) are shown to yield the same result (provided, the
   initial k seed points are same). But, the proposed method is much faster
   than the conventional one. Experimentally, the proposed method is
   compared with the conventional method and the other recent methods that
   are proposed to speed-up the k-means method.},

Abstract = {We introduce a new parallelization method for high-efficiency video
   coding (HEVC), which resolves the shortcomings of the existing
   tile-based parallel processing method. The parallel HEVC performs
   encoding by dividing a frame into numerous parallel units. This
   decreases the compression efficiency compared with sequential HEVC,
   because it artificially breaks the data correlation within a frame,
   which is called the parallelization overhead. The traditional parallel
   techniques such as Tiles and wavefront parallel processing (WPP)
   inherently introduce a high parallelization overhead because they simply
   divide a frame statically without considering the contents of the frame.
   The proposed new parallel encoding scheme resolves such problems by
   partitioning a frame based on the meaningful contents. In order to
   analyze the correlations within a frame and define the contents, the
   features within a frame are first extracted and clustered. In the
   feature clustering algorithm, two factors are considered to balance the
   workload between parallel units: (1) the number of features in each
   cluster and (2) the number of coding tree units (CTU) occupied by each
   cluster. The frame is partitioned based on the result of clustering, and
   the partitions are encoded in parallel. The proposed scheme achieves a
   bit-saving of up to 7.21\%, with an average of 3.71\%, along with an
   average time-saving of 20.50\% compared to the Tiles technique.},

Abstract = {This article introduces a multiclass classification approach accustoming
   the benefits of partitioning-based strategies and hierarchical
   techniques. The proposed hierarchical framework creates a hierarchy with
   the notion of grouping classes with similar traits as one group. It
   overcomes the deficiency of the existing multiclass extension
   approaches, viz., nonlinearity, imbalanced class classification, and
   increasing classification cost with increasing number of classes. The
   hierarchical framework presents the idea of decomposing several classes
   hierarchically, where every cluster contains a set of classes having
   similar traits. The approach aims to maximize the intercluster distance
   and minimize the intracluster distribution. The effectiveness of the
   proposed method is evaluated on real-world and complex problems of plant
   recognition. Three leaf image datasets are considered for performance
   evaluation using a support vector machine. The results signify that the
   proposed approach for multiclass classification is an efficient approach
   with significantly improved recognition accuracy. It is a robust and
   effective approach with the least computational cost. The speedup factor
   of the proposed approach in the binary structure is 16, 6.5, and 5.5 as
   compared to a one-versus-one traditional support vector machine for
   Flavia, Swedish, and self-collected leaf datasets, respectively.},

Abstract = {Fuzzy or hard partitioning methods aim at grouping objects according to
   their similarity. Recently, a new concept of partition based on belief
   function theory, called credal partition, has been proposed and has been
   shown to generate meaningful description of the data. Hard, fuzzy or
   credal partitions are generally obtained using unsupervised learning
   methods, using only the numeric description between two objects to
   compute their similarity. However, in some applications, some kind of
   background knowledge about the objects or about the clusters is
   available. To integrate this auxiliary information, constraint-based (or
   semi-supervised) methods have been proposed. A popular type of
   constraints specifies whether two objects are in the same cluster
   (must-link) or in different clusters (cannot-link). We propose here a
   new algorithm, called CECM, which computes a credal partition using a
   constrained clustering method. We show how to translate the available
   information into constraints, and how to integrate them in the search of
   the credal partition. The paper ends with some experimental results.
   Results of CECM are compared to other constrained clustering algorithms.
   Then an application in image segmentation is described.},

Abstract = {A key issue in cluster analysis is determining a proper dissimilarity
   measure between two data objects, and many pairwise dissimilarities have
   been proposed to deal with time series. Assuming that the clustering
   purpose is to group series according to the underlying dependence
   structures, a detailed study of the behavior in clustering of a
   dissimilarity based on comparing estimated quantile autocovariance
   functions (QAF) is carried out. Quantile autocovariances provide
   information about the serial dependence structure that other
   conventional features are not able to capture, which suggests great
   potential to perform clustering of series. The asymptotic behavior of
   the sample quantile autocovariances is studied and an algorithm to
   determine optimal combinations of lags and pairs of quantile levels to
   perform clustering is introduced. The proposed metric is used to perform
   hard and soft partitioning-based clustering. First, a broad simulation
   study examines the behavior of the proposed metric in crisp clustering
   with the PAM procedure. A novel fuzzy C-medoids algorithm based on the
   QAF-dissimilarity is then proposed and compared with other fuzzy
   procedures in a new simulation study conducted to cluster fuzzy
   scenarios involving AR and GARCH models. In all cases, the QAF-based
   procedures outperform or are highly competitive with a range of
   dissimilarities reported in the literature, particularly exhibiting high
   capability to cluster conditionally heteroskedastic time series and
   robustness to the distributional form of the errors. Two specific
   applications involving air quality data and financial time series
   illustrate the usefulness of the proposed procedures. (C) 2017 Elsevier

Abstract = {K-Means clustering algorithm is a typical partition-based clustering
   algorithm. Its two major disadvantages lie in the facts that the
   algorithm is sensitive to initial cluster centers and the outliers exert
   significant influence on the clustering results. In addition, K-Means
   algorithm traverses and computes all the data multiple times. Thus, the
   algorithm is not efficient when dealing with large data sets. In order
   to overcome the above limitations, this paper proposes to exclude the
   outliers using the minimum number of points in the d-dimensional
   hypersphere area. Then k cluster centers can be obtained by adjusting
   the threshold making use of density idea. Finally, K-Means algorithm
   will be integrated with Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA). The
   time efficiency is improved considerably through taking advantage of
   computing power of Graphic Processing Unit (GPU). We use the ratio of
   distance between classes to distance within classes and speedup as the
   evaluation criteria. The experiments indicate that the proposed
   algorithm significantly improves the stability and running efficiency of
   K-Means algorithm.},

Title = {Uncovering and Testing the Fuzzy Clusters Based on Lumped Markov Chain

Abstract = {Identifying clusters, namely groups of nodes with comparatively strong
   internal connectivity, is a fundamental task for deeply understanding
   the structure and function of a network. By means of a lumped Markov
   chain model of a random walker, we propose two novel ways of inferring
   the lumped markov transition matrix. Furthermore, some useful results
   are proposed based on the analysis of the properties of the lumped
   Markov process. To find the best partition of complex networks, a novel
   framework including two algorithms for network partition based on the
   optimal lumped Markovian dynamics is derived to solve this problem. The
   algorithms are constructed to minimize the objective function under this
   framework. It is demonstrated by the simulation experiments that our
   algorithms can efficiently determine the probabilities with which a node
   belongs to different clusters during the learning process and naturally
   supports the fuzzy partition. Moreover, they are successfully applied to
   real-world network, including the social interactions between members of
   a karate club.},

Title = {Joint Beamforming and Power Optimization With Iterative User Clustering
   for MISO-NOMA Systems},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {5},
Pages = {6872-6884},
Abstract = {In this paper, we minimize the transmit power for multiple-input
   single-output and nonorthogonal multiple access systems. In our
   analysis, a large number of users are partitioned into multiple user
   clusters/pairs with small size and uniform power allocation across the
   clusters and each cluster is associated with a beamforming vector. The
   considered optimization problem involves how to optimize beamforming
   vectors, power allocation, and user clustering. Considering the high
   computational complexity in solving the whole problem, we decompose the
   problem into two parts, and design a joint algorithm to iteratively
   optimize them. First, given a user partition, we formulate the
   beamforming and power allocation problem under a set of practical
   constraints. The problem is nonconvex. To tackle it, we reformulate,
   transform, and approximate the nonconvex problem to a quadratically
   constrained optimization problem, and develop a joint beamforming and
   power allocation algorithm based on semidefinite relaxation to solve it.
   Second, to address the issue of high complexity in obtaining the optimal
   clusters, we propose a low-complexity algorithm to efficiently identify
   a set of promising clusters, forming as a candidate user partition.
   Based on these two algorithms, we design an algorithmic framework to
   iteratively perform them and to improve performance. By the algorithm
   design, the produced user partition can be further improved in later
   iterations, in order to further reduce power consumption. Numerical
   results demonstrate that the performance of the proposed solution with
   iterative updates for user clustering, and joint beamforming and power
   allocation optimization outperforms that of previous schemes.},

Abstract = {Path queries over transportation networks are operations required by
   many Geographic Information Systems applications. Such networks,
   typically modeled as graphs composed of nodes and links and represented
   as link relations, can be very large and hence often need to be stored
   on secondary storage devices. Path query computation over such large
   persistent networks amounts to high I/O costs due to having to
   repeatedly bring in links from the link relation from secondary storage
   into the main memory buffer for processing. This paper is the first to
   present a comparative experimental evaluation of alternative graph
   clustering solutions in order to show their effectiveness in path query
   processing over transportation networks. Clustering optimization is
   attractive because it does not incur any run-time cost, requires no
   auxiliary data structures, and is complimentary to many of the existing
   solutions on path query processing. In this payer, we develop a novel
   clustering technique, called spatial partition clustering (SPC), that
   exploits unique properties of transportation networks such as spatial
   coordinates and high locality. We identify other promising candidates
   for clustering optimizations from the literature? such as two-way
   partitioning and approximate topological clustering. We fine-tune them
   to optimize their I/O behavior for path query processing. Our
   experimental evaluation of the performance of these graph clustering
   techniques using an actual city road network as well as randomly
   generated graphs considers variations in parameters such as memory
   buffer size, length of the paths, locality, and out-degree. Our
   experimental results are the foundation for establishing guidelines to
   select the best clustering technique based on the type of networks. We
   rind that our SPC performs the best for the highly interconnected city
   map; the hybrid approach for random graphs with high locality: and the
   two-way partitioning based on link weights for random graphs with no
   locality. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {An efficient heuristic force directed placement algorithm based on
   partitioning is proposed for very large-scale circuits. Our heuristic
   force directed approach provides a more efficient cell location
   adjustment scheme for iterative placement optimization than the force
   directed relaxation (FDR) method. We apply hierarchical partitioning
   based on a new parallel clustering technique to decompose circuit into
   several level sub-circuits. During the partitioning phase, a similar
   technique to `terminal propagation' was introduced so as to maintain the
   external connections that affect cell adjustment in sub-circuit. In
   these lowest level sub-circuits, the heuristic force directed algorithm
   is used to perform iterative placement optimization. Then each pair of
   sub-circuits resulted from bisection combine into a larger one, in which
   cells are located as the best placement state of either sub-circuits.
   The bottom-up combination is done successively until back to the
   original circuit, and at each combination level the heuristic force
   directed placement algorithm is used to further improve the placement
   quality. A set of MCNC ( Microelectronics Centre of North-Carolina)
   standard cell benchmarks is experimented and results show that our
   placement algorithm produces on average of 12\% lower total wire length
   than that of Feng Shui with a little longer CPU time.},

Abstract = {Data Stream mining has gained attraction from many researchers as there
   is need to mine large dataset which pose different challenges for
   researchers. Stream data is different compared to normal data as they
   are continuously produced from different applications which impose
   different challenges like massive, infinite, concept drift for
   processing. An object that does not obey the behavior of normal data
   object is called outliers. Outlier detection is used in different
   applications like fraud detection, intrusion detection, track
   environmental changes, medical diagnosis so there is need to detect
   outliers from data streams. Various approaches are used for outlier
   detection. Some of them use K-Means algorithm for outlier detection in
   data streams which help to create a similar group or cluster of data
   points. Data stream clustering techniques are highly helpful to cluster
   similar data items in data streams and also to detect the outliers from
   them, so they are called cluster based outlier detection. K-means
   algorithm is partition based algorithm which is used for clustering
   datasets into number of clusters. It is most common and popular
   algorithm for clustering due to its simplicity and efficiency. Purpose
   of this paper is to review of different approaches of outlier detection
   which is used for K-Means algorithm for clustering dataset with some
   other methods. Different application areas of outlier detection are
   discussed in this paper.},

Abstract = {The uncertainty of solar generation is a challenging issue for the
   operation and control of distribution systems. Also, because of the
   large number of control and operation variables in advanced distribution
   networks, the centralized optimization technique requires high
   computational capabilities. In this paper, a distributed voltage
   regulation approach in a distribution system based on the predictor
   corrector proximal multiplier (PCPM) algorithm has been presented. This
   paper focuses on the voltage rise in distribution systems with high
   penetration of photovoltaics. The proposed method uses a clustering
   approach to divide the network into partitions based on the coupling
   degrees among different nodes. The optimal reactive power control
   strategy is conducted in each partition and integrated using PCPM. The
   proposed method is tested on 69 and 123 nodes IEEE distribution test
   systems. The results confirmed that the proposed method achieves the
   optimal solution with the same accuracy as the centralized method but in
   a much shorter computation time.},

Title = {Sophisticated SOM based genetic operators in multi-objective clustering
   framework},
Journal = {APPLIED INTELLIGENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {49},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1803-1822},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Multi-objective clustering refers to the partitioning of a given
   collection of objects into various K -groups based on some
   similarity/dissimilarity criterion while optimizing different partition
   quality measures simultaneously. The current paper proposes an automated
   decomposition based multi-objective clustering technique, SOMDEA\_clust,
   which is a fusion of self-organizing map (SOM) and multi-objective
   differential evolution. A novel reproduction operator is designed where
   the ensemble of multiple neighborhoods extracted using self-organizing
   map is used for constructing the variable mating pool size. The
   probabilities of selecting different sizes of the neighborhood are
   updated based on their performances in generating new improved solutions
   in the last few generations. Decomposition based selection scheme is
   also utilized in our paper which divides the multi-objective
   optimization (MOO) problem into a number of single objective
   subproblems. The objective functions corresponding to these subproblems
   are optimized in a collaborative manner by the use of MOO. The
   potentiality of the proposed framework is shown for clustering four
   real-life data sets and five artificial data sets in comparison to some
   existing multi-objective based clustering techniques, namely MOCK,
   SMEA\_clust, MEA\_clust, a single objective based genetic clustering
   technique, SOGA and a traditional clustering technique, K-means. To show
   the utility of SOM based reproduction operators, another decomposition
   based multi-objective clustering technique (MDEA\_clust) without the use
   of SOM based operators is also developed in this paper. In order to show
   the efficacy of the proposed clustering technique in handling large data
   sets, two large scale datasets having more than 5000 data points are
   also utilized. As a real-life application, the proposed clustering
   technique is applied for scientific/web document clustering where a set
   of scientific/web documents are partitioned based on their
   content-similarities. Semantic representation is utilized to covert the
   text document into a real vector. Experimental results clearly
   illustrate the effectiveness of fusion of SOM and DE in developing an
   effective clustering technique.},

Title = {Self-adapted mixture distance measure for clustering uncertain data},
Journal = {KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {126},
Pages = {33-47},
Month = {JUN 15},
Abstract = {Distance measure plays an important role in clustering uncertain data.
   However, existing distance measures for clustering uncertain data suffer
   from some issues. Geometric distance measure can not identify the
   difference between uncertain objects with different distributions
   heavily overlapping in locations. Probability distribution distance
   measure can not distinguish the difference between different pairs of
   completely separated uncertain objects. In this paper, we propose a
   self-adapted mixture distance measure for clustering uncertain data
   which considers the geometric distance and the probability distribution
   distance simultaneously, thus overcoming the issues in previous distance
   measures. The proposed distance measure consists of three parts: (1) The
   induced kernel distance: it can be used to measure the geometric
   distance between uncertain objects. (2) The Jensen-Shannon divergence:
   it can be used to measure the probability distribution distance between
   uncertain objects. (3) The self-adapted weight parameter: it can be used
   to adjust the importance degree of the induced kernel distance and the
   Jensen Shannon divergence according to the location overlapping
   information of the dataset. The proposed distance measure is symmetric,
   finite and parameter adaptive. Furthermore, we integrate the
   self-adapted mixture distance measure into the partition-based and
   density-based algorithms for clustering uncertain data. Extensive
   experimental results on synthetic datasets, real benchmark datasets and
   real world uncertain datasets show that our proposed distance measure
   outperforms the existing distance measures for clustering uncertain
   data. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Over the last decade a variety of clustering algorithms have evolved.
   However one of the simplest (and possibly overused) partition based
   clustering algorithm is K-means. It can be shown that the computational
   complexity of K-means does not suffer from exponential growth with
   dimensionality rather it is linearly proportional with the number of
   observations and number of clusters. The crucial requirements are the
   knowledge of cluster number and the computation of some suitably chosen
   similarity measure. For this simplicity and scalability, among large
   data sets K-means remains an attractive alternative when compared to
   other competing clustering philosophies especially for high dimensional
   domain. However being a deterministic algorithm, traditional K-means
   have several drawbacks. It only offers hard decision rule, with no
   probabilistic interpretation. In this paper we have developed a decision
   theoretic framework by which traditional K-means can be given a
   probabilistic footstep. This will not only enable us to do a soft.
   clustering, rather the whole optimization problem could be re-casted
   into Bayesian modeling framework, in which the knowledge of cluster
   number could be treated as an unknown parameter of interest, thus
   removing a severe constrain of K-means algorithm. Our basic idea is to
   keep the simplicity and scalability of K-means, while achieving some of
   the desired properties of the other model based or soft clustering
   approaches.},

Abstract = {Existing methods of spatial data clustering have focused on point data,
   whose similarity can be easily defined. Due to the complex shapes and
   alignments of polygons, the similarity between non-overlapping polygons
   is important to cluster polygons. This study attempts to present an
   efficient method to discover clustering patterns of polygons by
   incorporating spatial cognition principles and multilevel graph
   partition. Based on spatial cognition on spatial similarity of polygons,
   four new similarity criteria (i.e. the distance, connectivity, size and
   shape) are developed to measure the similarity between polygons, and
   used to visually distinguish those polygons belonging to the same
   clusters from those to different clusters. The clustering method with
   multilevel graph-partition first coarsens the graph of polygons at
   multiple levels, using the four defined similarities to find clusters
   with maximum similarity among polygons in the same clusters, then
   refines the obtained clusters by keeping minimum similarity between
   different clusters. The presented method is a general algorithm for
   discovering clustering patterns of polygons and can satisfy various
   demands by changing the weights of distance, connectivity, size and
   shape in spatial similarity. The presented method is tested by
   clustering residential areas and buildings, and the results demonstrate
   its usefulness and universality.},

Title = {A clustering method for concurrent photos obtained from multiple cameras

Abstract = {With the popularization of digital cameras, the use of several cameras
   by group photographers at the same event is becoming common.
   Photographers can share their contents and even take pictures of each
   other. So it is becoming important to manage concurrent photos from
   multiple cameras in order to classify many accumulated photos into
   proper clusters. In this paper, we propose a novel photo clustering
   method based on the max-flow network algorithm, and we visualize a
   network graph for cluster verification. To apply our algorithm, input
   concurrent photos are used to create an edge-weighted graph structure.
   In order to transform the photo clustering problem into a graph
   partition one, first we need to construct an Augmented Concurrent photo
   Graph (ACG) and then rewrite our original problem in terms of the graph
   partition one using the min-cut max-flow network model. The previous
   methods dealt with photo clustering as a 1-D problem using a linear
   partition. But we consider clustering for concurrent group photos as a
   2-D partition based on other users' photo contents. Each photo is used
   to create a node and similarities between photos are used to create the
   edge weights (capacities) of the network. We partition the network into
   two subgraphs according to the min-cut, which represents the weakest
   edge connections between the photos. Using repeated graph partitions for
   each subgraph (sub-network), we can obtain suitable subgraphs
   corresponding to photo clusters. The graph construction or partition can
   be adjusted according to user preferences in order to obtain the
   intended results.},

Abstract = {Genetic Algorithm (GA) has been successfully applied to codebook design
   for vector quantization and its candidate solutions are normally turned
   by LBG algorithm. In this paper, to solve premature phenomenon and
   falling into local optimum of GA, a new Genetic Simulated
   Annealing-based Kernel Vector Quantization (GSAKVQ) is proposed from a
   different point of view. The simulated annealing (SA) method proposed in
   this paper can approach the optimal solution faster than the other
   candidate approaches. In the frame of GA, firstly, a new special
   crossover operator and a mutation operator are designed for the
   partition-based code scheme, and then a SA operation is introduced to
   enlarge the exploration of the proposed algorithm, finally, the Kernel
   function-based fitness is introduced into GA in order to cluster those
   datasets with complex distribution. The proposed method has been
   extensively compared with other algorithms on 17 datasets clustering and
   four image compression problems. The experimental results show that the
   algorithm can achieve its superiority in terms of clustering correct
   rate and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), and the robustness of
   algorithm is also very good. In addition, we took ``Lena{''} as an
   example and added Gaussian noise into the original image then adopted
   the proposed algorithm to compress the image with noise. Compared to the
   original image with noise, the reconstructed image is more distinct, and
   with the parameter value increasing, the value of PSNR decreases.},

   Methodology},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CIRCUITS SYSTEMS AND COMPUTERS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {29},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {Rectilinear Steiner Tree (RST) construction is a fundamental problem in
   very large scale integration (VLSI) physical design. Its applications
   include placement and routing in VLSI physical design automation (PDA)
   where wire length and timing estimations for signal nets are obtained.
   In this paper, a pseudo-Boolean satisfiability (PB-SAT)-based approach
   is presented to solve rectilinear Steiner tree problem. But large nets
   are a bottleneck for any SAT-based approach. Hence, to deal with large
   nets, a region-partitioning-based algorithm is taken into consideration,
   which eventually achieves a reasonable running time. Furthermore, a
   clustering-based approach is also explored to improve the partitioning
   of nets by identifying clusters and then applying a heuristic-based
   approach to get the minimum wire length for each set of the clusters.
   Experimental results obtained by these techniques show that the proposed
   algorithm can solve the RST problem very effectively even on large
   circuits and it outperforms the widely used RST algorithm FLUTE with 3 x
   to 9 x speedups.},

Abstract = {One of the most important problems in data mining is discovery of
   association rules in large database. In our previous study, we proposed
   parallel algorithms and candidate duplication based load balancing
   strategies for mining generalized association rules and showed our
   algorithms could attain good performance on 16 nodes parallel computer
   system. However, as the number of nodes increase, it would be difficult
   to achieve flat workload distribution.
   In this paper, we present the candidate partition based load balancing
   strategy for parallel algorithm of generalized association rule mining.
   This strategy partitions the candidate itemsets so that the number of
   candidate probes for each node is equalized each other with estimated
   support count by the information of previous pass. Moreover, we
   implement the parallel algorithms and load balancing strategies for
   mining generalized association rules on a cluster of 100 PCs
   interconnected with an ATM network, and analyze the performance using a
   large amount of transaction dataset. Through the several experiments, we
   showed the load balancing strategy, which partition the candidate
   itemsets with considering the distribution of candidate probes and
   duplicate the frequently occurring candidate itemsets, can attain high
   performance and achieve good workload distribution on one hundred PC
   cluster system.},

Title = {Relationship-based clustering and visualization for high-dimensional
   data mining},
Journal = {INFORMS JOURNAL ON COMPUTING},
Year = {2003},
Volume = {15},
Number = {2},
Pages = {208-230},
Month = {SPR},
Abstract = {In several real-life data-mining applications, data reside in very high
   (1000 or more) dimensional space, where both clustering techniques
   developed for low-dimensional spaces (k-means, BIRCH, CLARANS, CURE,
   DBScan, etc.) as well as visualization methods such as parallel
   coordinates or projective visualizations, are rendered ineffective. This
   paper proposes a relationship-based approach that alleviates both
   problems, side-stepping the ``curse-of-dimensionality{''} issue by
   working in a suitable similarity space instead of the original
   high-dimensional attribute space. This intermediary similarity space can
   be suitably tailored to satisfy business criteria such as requiring
   customer clusters to represent comparable amounts of revenue. We apply
   efficient and scalable graph-partitioning-based clustering techniques in
   this space. The output from the clustering algorithm is used to re-order
   the data points so that the resulting permuted similarity matrix can be
   readily visualized in two dimensions, with clusters showing up as bands.
   While two-dimensional visualization of a similarity matrix is by itself
   not novel, its combination with the order-sensitive partitioning of a
   graph that captures the relevant similarity measure between objects
   provides three powerful properties: (i) the high-dimensionality of the
   data does not affect further processing once the similarity space is
   formed; (ii) it leads to clusters of (approximately) equal importance,
   and (iii) related clusters show up adjacent to one another, further
   facilitating the visualization of results. The visualization is very
   helpful for assessing and improving clustering. For example, actionable
   recommendations for splitting or merging of clusters can be easily
   derived, and it also guides the user toward the right number of
   clusters. Results are presented on a real retail industry dataset of
   several thousand customers and products, as well as on clustering of
   web-document collections and of web-log sessions.},

Abstract = {Clustering is a powerful machine learning method for discovering similar
   patterns according to the proximity of elements in feature space. Here
   the authors propose a local direction centrality clustering algorithm
   that copes with heterogeneous density and weak connectivity issues.
   Clustering is a powerful machine learning method for discovering similar
   patterns according to the proximity of elements in feature space. It is
   widely used in computer science, bioscience, geoscience, and economics.
   Although the state-of-the-art partition-based and connectivity-based
   clustering methods have been developed, weak connectivity and
   heterogeneous density in data impede their effectiveness. In this work,
   we propose a boundary-seeking Clustering algorithm using the local
   Direction Centrality (CDC). It adopts a density-independent metric based
   on the distribution of K-nearest neighbors (KNNs) to distinguish between
   internal and boundary points. The boundary points generate enclosed
   cages to bind the connections of internal points, thereby preventing
   cross-cluster connections and separating weakly-connected clusters. We
   demonstrate the validity of CDC by detecting complex structured clusters
   in challenging synthetic datasets, identifying cell types from
   single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and mass cytometry (CyTOF) data,
   recognizing speakers on voice corpuses, and testifying on various types
   of real-world benchmarks.},

Abstract = {Feature selection or variable reduction is a fundamental problem in data
   mining, refers to the process of identifying the few most important
   features for application of a learning algorithm. The best subset
   contains the minimum number of dimensions retaining a suitably high
   accuracy on classifier in representing the original features. The
   objective of the proposed approach is to reduce the number of input
   features thus to identify the key features and eliminating irrelevant
   features with no predictive information using clustering technique,
   K-nearest neighbors (KNN) and rough set. This paper deals with two
   partition based clustering algorithm in data mining namely K-Means and
   Fuzzy C Means (FCM). These two algorithms are implemented for original
   data set without considering the class labels and further rough set
   theory implemented on the partitioned data set to generate feature
   subset after removing the outlier by using KNN. Wisconsin Breast Cancer
   datasets derived from UCI machine learning database are used for the
   purpose of testing the proposed hybrid method. The results show that the
   hybrid method is able to produce more accurate diagnosis and prognosis
   results than the full input model with respect to the classification
   accuracy.},

Abstract = {Automatic brain abnormality segmentation from magnetic resonance images
   is a key task that is performed by computer aided algorithm or manual
   extraction by a medical expert. The regions are often partitioned based
   on the similarities of intensities that persist in a particular region.
   MR brain image segmentation is a critical step that helps to identify
   the abnormal region. Accurate identification of this abnormal region
   helps the radiologist and surgeons in surgical process and research.
   Through this paper we present a hybrid approach of algorithms based on
   clustering approach like region and edge based algorithm involved in
   segmenting abnormal region from MR brain images. The method is an
   integration of region based (pillar K-means) and edge based (level set)
   segmentation algorithm that aims to segment the abnormal region
   precisely. Experimental results show that the proposed approach could
   attain segmentation efficiency of 89.2\%, mitigating the segmentation
   errors that were prevalent with region or edge based algorithms.},

   Hybrid Clouds},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Pages = {4895-4907},
Abstract = {With the rapid development of cloud computing services, more and more
   individuals and enterprises prefer to outsource their data or computing
   to clouds. In order to preserve data privacy, the data should be
   encrypted before outsourcing and it is a challenge to perform searches
   over encrypted data. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving
   multi-keyword ranked search scheme over encrypted data in hybrid clouds,
   which is denoted as MRSE-HC. The keyword dictionary of documents is
   clustered into balanced partitions by a bisecting k-means clustering
   based keyword partition algorithm. According to the partitions, the
   keyword partition based bit vectors are adopted for documents and
   queries which are utilized as the index of searches. The private cloud
   filters out the candidate documents by the keyword partition based bit
   vectors, and then the public cloud uses the trapdoor to determine the
   result in the candidates. On the basis of the MRSE-HC scheme, an
   enhancement scheme EMRSE-HC is proposed, which adds complete binary
   pruning tree to further improve search efficiency. The security analysis
   and performance evaluation show that MRSE-HC and EMRSE-HC are
   privacy-preserving multi-keyword ranked search schemes for hybrid clouds
   and outperforms the existing scheme FMRS in terms of search efficiency.},

Abstract = {A partitioning-based placement algorithm with priori wirelength
   estimation called HJ-hPl is presented in this paper. We propose a new
   methodology to estimate proximity of wirelengths in a netlist, which is
   capable of estimating not only short interconnects but long
   interconnects accurately. We embed the wirelength estimation into the
   partitioning tool of our global placement, which can guide our placement
   towards a solution with shorter wirelengths. In addition, we employ a
   regular structure clustering technique to reduce the size of the
   original placement, which can also bring on a lighter placement result.
   Experimental results show that, compared to Capo 10.5. mPL6, and
   NTUplace, HJ-hPl outperforms theirs in term Of wirelength and run time.
   The improvements in terms of average wirelength over Capo 10.5, mPL6 and
   NPUplace are 13\%, 3\%, and 9\% with only 19\%, 91\%, and 99\% of their
   runtime, respectively. By integrating our estimated wirelength driven
   clustering into Capo 10.5, we are able to reduce average wirelength by
   3\%.},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Detection of clustered microcalcification (MC) from
   mammograms plays essential roles in computer-aided diagnosis for early
   stage breast cancer.
   OBJECTIVE: To tackle problems associated with the diversity of data
   structures of MC lesions and the variability of normal breast tissues,
   multi-pattern sample space learning is required.
   METHODS: In this paper, a novel grouped fuzzy Support Vector Machine
   (SVM) algorithm with sample space partition based on
   Expectation-Maximization (EM) (called G-FSVM) is proposed for clustered
   MC detection. The diversified pattern of training data is partitioned
   into several groups based on EM algorithm. Then a series of fuzzy SVM
   are integrated for classification with each group of samples from the MC
   lesions and normal breast tissues.
   RESULTS: From DDSM database, a total of 1,064 suspicious regions are
   selected from 239 mammography, and the measurement of Accuracy, True
   Positive Rate (TPR), False Positive Rate (FPR) and EVL = TPR{*} root
   1-FPR are 0.82, 0.78, 0.14 and 0.72, respectively.
   CONCLUSION: The proposed method incorporates the merits of fuzzy SVM and
   multi-pattern sample space learning, decomposing the MC detection
   problem into serial simple two-class classification. Experimental
   results from synthetic data and DDSM database demonstrate that our
   integrated classification framework reduces the false positive rate
   significantly while maintaining the true positive rate.},

Abstract = {Finding clusters of arbitrary shapes in data streams is a challenging
   work for advanced applications. An effective approach to clustering
   arbitrary shapes is the clustering algorithm based on space partition.
   However, it cannot be applied directly into data stream clustering since
   it costs large memory spaces while data stream processing has strict
   memory space limitation. In addition, it has low efficiency for high
   dimensional data and fine granularity. Moreover, its fixed granularity
   partition isn't suitable for the changes on data distribution of data
   streams. Therefore, we propose a novel index structure CDS-Tree and
   design an improved space partition based clustering algorithm, which
   aims to cluster arbitrary shapes on high dimension streams data with
   high accuracy. CDS-Tree stores only non-empty cells and keeps the
   position relationship among cells, so its compact structure costs small
   memory spaces and gets high efficiency. Moreover, we propose a novel
   measure for data skew-DSF (Data Skew Factor) to be used to adjust
   automatically the partition granularity according to the change of data
   streams, thus the algorithm can gain high analysis accuracy within
   limited memory. The experimental results on real datasets and synthetic
   datasets show that this algorithm has higher clustering accuracy, and
   better scalability with the size of windows and data dimensionality than
   other typical algorithms applied in trivial style.},

Abstract = {We consider a geometric approach to graph partitioning based on the
   graph Beltrami energy, a discrete version of a functional that appears
   in classical minimal surface problems. More specifically, the optimality
   criterion is given by the sum of the minimal Beltrami energies of the
   partition components. Since the Beltrami energy interpolates between the
   Total Variation and Dirichlet energies, various results for optimal
   partitions for these two energies can be recovered. We adapt primal-dual
   convex optimization methods to solve for the minimal Beltrami energy for
   each component of a given partition. A rearrangement algorithm is
   proposed to find the graph partition to minimize a relaxed version of
   the objective. The method is applied to several clustering problems on
   graphs constructed from manifold discretizations, synthetic data, the
   MNIST handwritten digit dataset, and image segmentation. The model has a
   semisupervised extension and provides a natural representative for the
   clusters as well.},

Abstract = {Brain segmentation is important in the field of neuropsychiatric
   disorders. With Computed Tomography (CT) scan being the gold standard in
   brain scan, brain segmentation in CT images is also very important in
   the detection of many pathology related to the brain. Fuzzy c-Means
   (FCM) is a popular method in data clustering and also in image
   segmentation due to it being robust. Graph cut is a segmentation
   algorithm that is able to separate the image into several partitions
   based on the similarity between each nodes in the image. In this paper,
   the CT scan images were first processed with FCM optimization and are
   separated into clusters based on pixel intensity. After that the
   post-FCM images were then loaded into the graph cut algorithm to
   separate the images into partitions, allowing users to manually select
   the appropriate partitions that best represent the brain region. The
   results showed that the images are less erroneous when they are
   clustered first with FCM before going through the graph cut algorithm.},

Abstract = {This paper addresses one of the attack methods where threat actors break
   into secure networks through virtual private networks (VPN) to launch
   tunneling based encrypted attacks, obfuscated advanced persistent
   threats and malware. The paper proposes Naive Bayes augmented with deep
   reinforcement learning (DRL) and fuzzy k-means clustering to classify
   VPN and non-VPN data. The proposed method is validated on the publicly
   available UNB-CIC VPN non-VPN dataset and shows an accuracy comparable
   to other state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms for traffic
   characterization. The proposed approach for traffic characterization of
   traffic classes (e.g., FTP and P2P) and application identification
   (e.g., Netflix and Amazon Prime) is analyzed for traffic-class detection
   efficiency and accuracy, and the ability to distinguish between VPN and
   non-VPN network traffic. The experimental results reveal that an optimum
   network traffic classification is achieved for `NB+DRL' approach, where
   DRL is used to reinforce the NB classification model through iterative
   policy evaluation and improvement and achieves recall of 0.96 in traffic
   categorization and 0.95 in application identification. This is further
   improved with fuzzy k-means clustering to reduce computational costs for
   encrypted network traffic classification using `NB+DRL+fuzzy k-means
   clustering', where the class partitions based on k-means converge to a
   local minimum based on dissimilarity measures for given packet features.
   The test set F1 scores of 0.973 and 0.965 are achieved for traffic
   characterization and application identification, respectively.},

Abstract = {The overrun problem of the short circuit current has been restricting
   the development of large urban power grid. Breaking up the high and low
   voltage electromagnetic loop network({''}loop breaking{''} for short) is
   an effective solution. However, in recent years, the uncertainty of
   power grid planning and the flexible requirements of system operation
   are sharply increased, which makes the loop breaking scheme has to be
   rolling adjusted in time. But the traditional loop breaking analysis
   methods are difficult to meet the timeliness. In the paper, a fast loop
   breaking method based on the network partition algorithm is provided.
   Its advantage is using clustering method to replace the traversal search
   of transmission line breaking combination. In this way, the
   Non-deterministic Polynomial (NP) complete problem can be avoid. The
   time consuming can be reduced to less than 1\% of the traditional
   method. Efficiency improved significantly. The method is double layer
   structure: the first layer is grouping analysis of the high to low
   voltage downlink buses, and the second layer is network partition based
   on the grouping results. Case study shows that the effective loop
   breaking schemes of a real large urban power grid can be obtain in
   minutes. Therefore, it can be applied to the practical engineering.},

Abstract = {The goal of current research is to compare the data clustering
   techniques and cluster validity indices for geometrical feature
   extraction using point cloud. Here, the point clouds are generated by
   slicing of the computer-aided design (CAD) surface, and the data on each
   slice is used as inputs to the clustering algorithms. The clustering
   techniques are used to detect the multiple closed contours on the planer
   datasets. In this paper, the four most popular clustering techniques,
   i.e., partition-based (K-means), density-based (DBSCAN), single linkage
   hierarchical clustering, a variant of hierarchical clustering, and
   graph-based (spectral) clustering technique are compared using four
   different datasets. The single linkage hierarchical clustering is
   preferred over the other variants as it detects the arbitrarily shaped
   clusters efficiently and effectively. The comparison is based on the
   ability of successful detection of the closed contours on the planer
   dataset, the time required, and the input needed for the algorithm. From
   the investigations, it is found that DBSCAN is the most suitable
   technique for the feature-based toolpaths (FBTs) development. Besides,
   for the quality assessment of the clustering solutions and to pinpoint
   the superlative validity indices, techniques like Calinski-Harabasz,
   Ball-Hall, Davies-Bouldin, Dunn, Det Ratio, Silhouette, Trace WiB, and
   Log Det Ratio are compared. The solutions of the clustering techniques
   are used to compare the validity indices. On the basis of comparative
   analysis, it is concluded that the Ball-Hall, Dunn, Det Ratio, and Log
   Det Ratio indices are the best validity criterions for the arbitrary
   shaped closed contours. The overall outcomes of this research will help
   in building the algorithms for the feature-based toolpath development
   strategies for the various manufacturing processes using data science
   and machine learning techniques.},

Title = {DPCF: A framework for imputing missing values and clustering data in
   drug discovery process},
Journal = {CHEMOMETRICS AND INTELLIGENT LABORATORY SYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {231},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {The advent of modern Internet of Things (IoT) architectures has led to
   ease in data collection and availability. The data generated from such
   architectures are of large volume and dimensionality. As a result, data
   missingness and data labeling are the commonly occurring problems in the
   data collection process when data volume is too large. Data clustering
   is a commonly used unsupervised pattern classification technique that
   helps in identifying the hidden structure of the datasets and clusters
   or groups similar data items together. In context to chemo-metrics,
   clustering techniques play a significant role in identifying the
   structure-property relationships and structure-activity relationships
   among different compounds in drug discovery process. The quantitative
   structure-property relationships (QSPR) are based on the similar
   property principle which states that if the com-pounds are clustered
   together based on structural descriptors, the compounds within the same
   cluster will have similar properties. The quantitative
   structure-activity relationships (QSAR) help in determining the
   empirical relationships between chemical structure and biological
   activity of a set of identical compounds. Hence, a variety of compounds
   can be divided into homogeneous subsets using cluster analysis. The
   effectiveness of any clustering algorithm mostly depends on how
   efficiently the initial cluster centers are identified. Traditional
   techniques that mostly rely on the random selection of initial cluster
   centers and different parameter settings may result in distinct clusters
   for the same dataset. Moreover, if the initial cluster centers selected
   are outliers then the clusters formed are of poor quality. The quality
   of each cluster can be determined by using distinct cluster validation
   indices (CVIs). This paper aims to solve the problems of data
   missingness as well as data labeling for unsuper-vised datasets. In
   continuation to the previous study where the NMVI (Nullify the Missing
   Values before Imputation) technique efficiently imputes the missing
   values in different datasets, in this paper the proposed DPCF (Data
   Partitioning-based Clustering Framework) framework utilize the NMVI
   technique to impute the missing values and a novel Z-Clust clustering
   algorithm is proposed that efficiently clusters the unlabeled data
   samples. The integration of the NMVI technique and Z-Clust clustering
   technique in the proposed framework makes it well suited for the
   analysis of unsupervised datasets having missing values. The performance
   evaluation of the proposed Z-Clust clustering technique is done by using
   five standard CVIs and the results are compared with the existing
   clustering techniques. The experimental results depict that the proposed
   Z-Clust clustering technique shows better cluster formation as compared
   to the existing clustering techniques. Henceforth, the proposed DPCF
   framework is well suited for the analysis of datasets without labels and
   having missing values.},

Abstract = {Clustering is the most common method for organizing unlabeled data into
   its natural groups (called clusters), based on similarity (in some sense
   or another) among data objects. The Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM)
   algorithm belongs to the partitioning-based methods of clustering widely
   used for objects categorization, image analysis, bioinformatics and data
   compression, but due to its high time complexity, the PAM algorithm
   cannot be used with large datasets or in any embedded or real-time
   application. In this work, we propose a simple and scalable parallel
   architecture for the PAM algorithm to reduce its running time. This
   architecture can easily be implemented either on a multi-core processor
   system to deal with big data or on a reconfigurable hardware platform,
   such as FPGA and MPSoCs, which makes it suitable for real-time
   clustering applications. Our proposed model partitions data equally
   among multiple processing cores. Each core executes the same sequence of
   tasks simultaneously on its respective data subset and shares
   intermediate results with other cores to produce results. Experiments
   show that the computational complexity of the PAM algorithm is reduced
   exponentially as we increase the number of cores working in parallel. It
   is also observed that the speedup graph of our proposed model becomes
   more linear with the increase in number of data points and as the
   clusters become more uniform. The results also demonstrate that the
   proposed architecture produces the same results as the actual PAM
   algorithm, but with reduced computational complexity.},

Abstract = {The success of cluster analysis for revealing natural grouping in a
   dataset depends heavily on the chosen dissimilarity measure. Recently,
   several attempts have been made to replace the popular Euclidean
   distance measure for dissimilarity with divergences that are known to
   disobey triangular inequality. In this Letter, a representative
   partitioning based superpixel algorithm called Simple Linear Iterative
   Clustering (SLIC) is experimented with a divergence measure. In
   particular, the Jeffery divergence is employed for dissimilarity
   computation between colour-image plane space vectors while performing
   cluster assignment. Despite being a non-metric, the Jeffery divergence
   based SLIC has shown better boundary adherence performance on BSDS500
   dataset as compared to the conventional SLIC algorithm.},

Abstract = {The paper presents a parameterized approximation scheme for
   probabilistic inference. The scheme, called Mini-Clustering (MC),
   extends the partition-based approximation offered by mini-bucket
   elimination, to tree decompositions. The benefit of this extension is
   that all single-variable beliefs are computed (approximately) at once,
   using a two-phase message-passing process along the cluster tree. The
   resulting approximation scheme allows adjustable levels of accuracy and
   efficiency, in anytime style. Empirical evaluation against competing
   algorithms such as iterative belief propagation and Gibbs sampling
   demonstrates the potential of the MC approximation scheme for several
   classes of problems.},

Abstract = {The fault is inevitable in case of the wireless sensor network (WSN)
   because of its remote deployment and constrained architecture. In
   literature, many algorithms have been proposed to address several types
   of fault in the WSN life-cycle. In the context of fault tolerance, the
   clustering method has been adopted as a proven technique. Heintzelman et
   al. first considered the clustering technique and proposed the seminal
   low energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (LEACH) algorithm for fault
   handling in WSN. In this study, the authors propose a LEACH variant
   clustering convention called partitioned-based energy-efficient - LEACH
   (PE-LEACH) protocol which tends to the energy-based fault-tolerant
   technique. They also study and present a taxonomy on LEACH variants. The
   execution of PE-LEACH is analysed against its predecessors;
   hard-computing based LEACH, energy-efficient LEACH (E-LEACH) convention
   and soft-computing-based energy-swarm-optimisation LEACH (ESO-LEACH).
   They have found through their recreation that PE-LEACH outperforms than
   LEACH and E-LEACH separately whereas, for ESO-LEACH the PE-LEACH is a
   tough competitor.},

Abstract = {Community detection has become an extremely active area of research in
   recent years, with researchers proposing various new metrics and
   algorithms to address the problem. Recently, the Weighted Community
   Clustering (WCC) metric was proposed as a novel way to judge the quality
   of a community partitioning based on the distribution of triangles in
   the graph, and was demonstrated to yield superior results over other
   commonly used metrics like modularity. The same authors later presented
   a parallel algorithm for optimizing WCC on large graphs. In this paper,
   we propose a new distributed, vertex-centric algorithm for community
   detection using the WCC metric. Results are presented that demonstrate
   the algorithm's performance and scalability on up to 32 worker machines
   and real graphs of up to 1.8 billion edges. The algorithm scales best
   with the largest graphs, finishing in just over an hour for the largest
   graph, and to our knowledge, it is the first distributed algorithm for
   optimizing the WCC metric.},

Abstract = {Generating a configuration for a field-programmable gate array (FPGA)
   starting from a high level description of a design is a time consuming
   task. The resulting configuration should have a high quality so that the
   FPGA resources are used in an efficient way while being able to run at
   high clock frequencies and having a low power consumption. In this
   paper, we present MULTIPART, a new hierarchical packing algorithm that
   obtains better quality and faster runtimes when compared to the
   frequently used AAPack packer in VPR. MULTIPART combines the benefits of
   partitioning-based and seed-based packing approaches. It tries to
   preserve the design hierarchy during packing. This results in a gain of
   32\% in total wirelength and a gain of 10\% in critical path delay. The
   partitioning-based methodology allows us to exploit multithreading,
   leading to 9.3x faster packing runtimes on a CPU with 10 cores. We also
   gain in the total routing runtime because MULTIPART reduces congestion
   problems on a higher level. The subcircuits in the partitioned circuit
   are clustered with a seed-based packer. This allows MULTIPART to deal
   with the constraints of complex heterogeneous architectures. In short,
   MULTIPART targets heterogeneous commercial FPGAs with a lower runtime
   while increasing the quality of the configuration. The source code of
   MULTIPART is available in our FPGA CAD framework on Github.},

Title = {Effectiveness of Partition and Graph Theoretic Clustering Algorithms for
   Multiple Source Partial Discharge Pattern Classification Using
   Probabilistic Neural Network and Its Adaptive Version: A Critique Based
   on Experimental Studies},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL AND COMPUTER ENGINEERING},
Year = {2012},

Abstract = {Partial discharge (PD) is amajor cause of failure of power apparatus and
   hence its measurement and analysis have emerged as a vital field in
   assessing the condition of the insulation system. Several efforts have
   been undertaken by researchers to classify PD pulses utilizing
   artificial intelligence techniques. Recently, the focus has shifted to
   the identification of multiple sources of PD since it is often
   encountered in real-time measurements. Studies have indicated that
   classification of multi-source PD becomes difficult with the degree of
   overlap and that several techniques such as mixed Weibull functions,
   neural networks, and wavelet transformation have been attempted with
   limited success. Since digital PD acquisition systems record data for a
   substantial period, the database becomes large, posing considerable
   difficulties during classification. This research work aims firstly at
   analyzing aspects concerning classification capability during the
   discrimination of multisource PD patterns. Secondly, it attempts at
   extending the previous work of the authors in utilizing the novel
   approach of probabilistic neural network versions for classifying
   moderate sets of PD sources to that of large sets. The third focus is on
   comparing the ability of partition-based algorithms, namely, the
   labelled (learning vector quantization) and unlabelled (K-means)
   versions, with that of a novel hypergraph-based clustering method in
   providing parsimonious sets of centers during classification.},

Abstract = {The application of Support Vector Machine (SVM) over data stream is
   growing with the increasing real-time processing requirements in
   classification field, like anomaly detection and real-time image
   processing. However, the dynamic live data with high volume and fast
   arrival rate in data streams make it challenging to apply SVM in data
   stream processing. Existing SVM implementations are mostly designed for
   batch processing and hardly satisfy the efficiency requirement of stream
   processing for its inherent complexity. To address the challenges, we
   propose a high efficiency distributed SVM framework over data stream
   (HDSVM), which consists of two main algorithms, incremental learning
   algorithm and distributed algorithm. Firstly, we propose a partial
   support vectors reserving incremental learning algorithm (PSVIL). By
   selecting a subset of support vectors based on their distances to
   classification hyperplane instead of the universal set to update SVM,
   the algorithm achieves lower time overhead while ensuring accuracy.
   Secondly, we propose a distribution remaining partition and fast
   aggregation distributed algorithm (DRPFA) for SVM. The real-time data is
   partitioned based on the original distribution with clustering instead
   of random partition, and historical support vectors are partitioned
   based on their distances to the classification hyperplane. The global
   hyperplane can be obtained by averaging the parameters of local
   hyperplanes due to the above partition strategy. Extensive experiments
   on Apache Storm show that the proposed HDSVM achieve lower time overhead
   and similar accuracy compared with the state-of-art. Speed-up ratio is
   increased by 2-8 times within 1\% accuracy deviation.},

Abstract = {A number of noteworthy techniques have been put forth recently in
   different research fields for comparing clusterings. Herein, we
   introduce a new method for comparing soft (fuzzy, probabilistic, and
   possibilistic) partitions based on the earth mover's distance (EMD) and
   the ordered weighted average (OWA). The proposed method is a metric,
   depending on the ground distance, for all but possibilistic partitions.
   It is extremely flexible due to its EMD formulation, OWA aggregation,
   and abstract concept of ground distance. In theory, our method is
   agnostic to the type (uncertainty) of soft partition, clustering
   algorithm, and distance measure used in the clustering algorithm(s), and
   it is applicable to the clustering of both object and relational data.
   Validation is performed theoretically, experimentally, as well as in
   terms of computational complexity. Emphasis is placed on the set of
   possibilistic partitions, specifically noise and coincident clusters,
   which are important cases that have received little to no attention to
   date in the comparing clustering literature. Improvements are reported
   in terms of metric properties and computational complexity over existing
   extended concordance/discordance (e. g., soft Rand and Jaccard)
   approaches and improved design and robustness in comparison with
   existing transportation problem-based approaches.},

   biology and financial area, so mining the multilevel and generalized
   association rules is one of the most important research task in data
   mining. Unlike the traditional algorithm, which is based on Apriori
   method, we propose a new CBP (correlation based partition) based method,
   to mine the multilevel and generalized frequent itemsets. This method
   uses the item's correlation as measurement to partition the transaction
   database from top to bottom. It can shorten the time of mining
   multilevel and generalized frequent itemsets by reducing the scanning
   scope of the transaction database. The experiments on the real-life
   financial transaction database show that the CBP based algorithms
   outperform the well-known Apriori based algorithms.},

Title = {Fuzzy Divisive Hierarchical Clustering of Solvents According to Their
   Experimentally and Theoretically Predicted Descriptors},
Journal = {SYMMETRY-BASEL},
Year = {2020},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The present study describes a simple procedure to separate into patterns
   of similarity a large group of solvents, 259 in total, presented by 15
   specific descriptors (experimentally found and theoretically predicted
   physicochemical parameters). Solvent data is usually characterized by
   its high variability, different molecular symmetry, and spatial
   orientation. Methods of chemometrics can usefully be used to extract and
   explore accurately the information contained in such data. In this
   order, advanced fuzzy divisive hierarchical-clustering methods were
   efficiently applied in the present study of a large group of solvents
   using specific descriptors. The fuzzy divisive hierarchical
   associative-clustering algorithm provides not only a fuzzy partition of
   the solvents investigated, but also a fuzzy partition of descriptors
   considered. In this way, it is possible to identify the most specific
   descriptors (in terms of higher, smallest, or intermediate values) to
   each fuzzy partition (group) of solvents. Additionally, the partitioning
   performed could be interpreted with respect to the molecular symmetry.
   The chemometric approach used for this goal is fuzzy c-means method
   being a semi-supervised clustering procedure. The advantage of such a
   clustering process is the opportunity to achieve separation of the
   solvents into similarity patterns with a certain degree of membership of
   each solvent to a certain pattern, as well as to consider possible
   membership of the same object (solvent) in another cluster. Partitioning
   based on a hybrid approach of the theoretical molecular descriptors and
   experimentally obtained ones permits a more straightforward separation
   into groups of similarity and acceptable interpretation. It was shown
   that an important link between objects' groups of similarity and
   similarity groups of variables is achieved. Ten classes of solvents are
   interpreted depending on their specific descriptors, as one of the
   classes includes a single object and could be interpreted as an outlier.
   Setting the results of this research into broader perspective, it has
   been shown that the fuzzy clustering approach provides a useful tool for
   partitioning by the variables related to the main physicochemical
   properties of the solvents. It gets possible to offer a simple guide for
   solvents recognition based on theoretically calculated or experimentally
   found descriptors related to the physicochemical properties of the
   solvents.},

Title = {Feature Extraction Based on Pyramid Match Kernel Algorithm with Adaptive
   Partitioning},

Year = {2017},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In order to extract human action features effectively under the
   panoramic view, we propose a novel PMK algorithm with adaptive
   partitioning based on the original shape context feature matching
   algorithm. First we combine optical imaging principle with the
   projection characteristics of human body under the panoramic view, and
   utilize the second moment to correct the principal axes direction of
   human contour. Then do the uniform sampling with the edge points, and
   extract the shape context feature at each sample point. In the process
   of matching sampling points, through the analysis of the distribution
   characteristics of sampling points in the high dimensional feature
   space, we introduce adaptive partitioning to Pyramid Match Kernel (PMK)
   algorithm to improve the convergence strategy. According to the range of
   data points at each dimension, the improved algorithm can adjust
   convergence coefficient the data adaptively, thus achieving the
   consistent convergence speed of the points set at each dimension.
   Finally we perform an experiment on fall indoor detection to verify the
   reliability of the proposed algorithm, and the K-means clustering
   algorithm is used for classification,the recognition rate can reach
   92.9\%. The results show that the improved feature extraction algorithm
   can provide the guarantee for the stability of the intelligent
   monitoring system.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND GRAPHICAL STATISTICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {26},
Number = {2},
Pages = {265-274},
Abstract = {We consider Bayesian nonparametric regression through random partition
   models. Our approach involves the construction of a covariate-dependent
   prior distribution on partitions of individuals. Our goal is to use
   covariate information to improve predictive inference. To do so, we
   propose a prior on partitions based on the Potts clustering model
   associated with the observed covariates. This drives by covariate
   proximity both the formation of clusters, and the prior predictive
   distribution. The resulting prior model is flexible enough to support
   many different types of likelihood models. We focus the discussion on
   nonparametric regression. Implementation details are discussed for the
   specific case of multivariate multiple linear regression. The proposed
   model performs well in terms of model fitting and prediction when
   compared to other alternative nonparametric regression approaches. We
   illustrate the methodology with an application to the health status of
   nations at the turn of the 21st century. Supplementary materials are

Title = {An efficient active learning method for multi-task learning},
Journal = {KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {190},
Month = {FEB 29},
Abstract = {In multi-task learning, the sharing of information between related tasks
   affects and promotes the learning of each task. However, the traditional
   multi-task learning techniques always require sufficient labeled data to
   improve the learning of each task, and labeling samples is always
   expensive in practice. In this paper, we propose two variants of active
   learning methods for multi-task classification. In the uncertainty step,
   we propose the support vector preservation criterion that evaluates
   uncertainty at the level of classifier, which is called classifier-level
   uncertainty (CLU). In the diversity step, we propose two diversity
   criteria that evaluate diversity by the clustering method and the
   partition method respectively, which are called clustering-based
   diversity (CBD) and partition-based diversity (PBD) respectively. Each
   diversity criterion together with the uncertainty criterion is to form
   an active learning method for multi-task learning. In addition, the
   proposed support vector preservation criterion selects local informative
   samples which determine the hyperplane for each task. Furthermore, in
   order to maintain the distribution structure of the samples, we put
   forward the micro-kernel k-means clustering method and partition-based
   method to select global informative samples from the non-support
   vectors. By incorporating the local and global informative samples into
   active learning, we propose the two active learning methods for
   multi-task problems. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed
   methods by conducting experiments with other active learning methods.
   The experimental results show that the proposed two methods perform
   better than other active learning methods. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {Novel Two-Fold Data Aggregation and MAC Scheduling to Support Energy
   Efficient Routing in Wireless Sensor Network},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Pages = {1260-1274},
Abstract = {Network lifetime maximization is the primary challenge in the wireless
   sensor network (WSN) due to its resource limitations. (ER2)-R-2 routing
   algorithm uses a hierarchical WSN model to minimize energy consumption
   in the WSN. However, it increases complexity, time consumption, and
   energy consumption due to the hierarchical model. To resolve these
   problems, this paper proposes a novel ring partitioned based MAC
   (RP-MAC) protocol for the energy-efficient WSN with a mobile sink node.
   Energy efficiency is achieved by the following phases: clustering phase,
   MAC scheduling phase, data aggregation phase, and routing phase.
   Clustering phase is initiated by a weighted Voronoi diagram (WVD)
   algorithm by assigning a weight value for each node. Energy consumption
   due to idle listening is minimized by enabling novel RP-MAC scheduling
   in each cluster. Involvement of RP-MAC protocol also achieves
   collision-free data transmission in the network. A two-fold data
   aggregation (TFDA) scheme is proposed for the data aggregation phase to
   minimize energy consumption by reducing the number of transmissions.
   Routing phase supports both intra-cluster routing and inter-cluster
   routing. For intra-cluster routing, a hybrid chicken swarm optimization
   algorithm is proposed. For inter-cluster routing, position-based routing
   tree is constructed based on the sink node's position. Our proposed
   RP-MAC protocol minimizes energy consumption in all possible ways for
   improving the network lifetime. Extensive simulation in ns-3 shows that
   the RP-MAC protocol achieves promising results in the following
   performance metrics: the number of dead nodes, average energy
   consumption, network lifetime, and throughput.},

Title = {MapReduce based improved quick reduct algorithm with granular refinement
   using vertical partitioning scheme},
Journal = {KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {189},
Month = {FEB 15},
Abstract = {In the last few decades, rough sets have evolved to become an essential
   technology for feature subset selection by way of reduct computation in
   categorical decision systems. In recent years with the proliferation of
   MapReduce for distributed/parallel algorithms, several scalable reduct
   computation algorithms have been developed in this field for large-scale
   decision systems using MapReduce. The existing MapReduce based reduct
   computation approaches use horizontal partitioning (division in object
   space) of the dataset into the nodes of the cluster, requiring a
   complicated shuffle and sort phase. In this work, we propose an
   algorithm MR\_IQRA\_VP which is designed using vertical partitioning
   (division in attribute space) of the dataset with a simplified shuffle
   and sort phase of the MapReduce framework. MR\_IQRA\_VP is a
   distributed/parallel implementation of the Improved Quick Reduct
   Algorithm (IQRA\_IG) and is implemented using iterative MapReduce
   framework of Apache Spark. We have done an extensive comparative study
   through experimentation on benchmark decision systems using existing
   horizontal partitioning based reduct computation algorithms. Through
   experimental analysis, along with theoretical validation, we have
   established that MR\_IQRA\_VP is suitable and scalable to datasets of
   larger size attribute space and moderate object space prevalent in the
   areas of Bioinformatics and Web mining. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {As the explosive growth of online linked data, the task of mining link
   patterns attracts more and more attention. A practical issue is how to
   perform mining efficiently in large-scale linked data. Existing pattern
   mining algorithms usually assume that the dataset can fit into the main
   memory, while linked data of billion triples is far beyond the memory
   limitation. In this paper we give a pilot study of a novel partitioning
   strategy for mining link patterns in large-scale linked data. First, we
   propose an algorithm named ParGroup to divide and group large linked
   data to partitions based on vertex label; Second, an adapted gSpan is
   applied for mining link patterns in each partition; At last, discovered
   link patterns are merged into a global result set. Experiments show that
   our strategy is feasible and promising in some scenarios.},

Title = {Detecting community structure using label propagation with consensus
   weight in complex network},
Journal = {CHINESE PHYSICS B},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {23},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Community detection is a fundamental work to analyse the structural and
   functional properties of complex networks. The label propagation
   algorithm (LPA) is a near linear time algorithm to find a good community
   structure. Despite various subsequent advances, an important issue of
   this algorithm has not yet been properly addressed. Random update orders
   within the algorithm severely hamper the stability of the identified
   community structure. In this paper, we executed the basic label
   propagation algorithm on networks multiple times, to obtain a set of
   consensus partitions. Based on these consensus partitions, we created a
   consensus weighted graph. In this consensus weighted graph, the weight
   value of the edge was the proportion value that the number of node pairs
   allocated in the same cluster was divided by the total number of
   partitions. Then, we introduced consensus weight to indicate the
   direction of label propagation. In label update steps, by computing the
   mixing value of consensus weight and label frequency, a node adopted the
   label which has the maximum mixing value instead of the most frequent
   one. For extending to different networks, we introduced a proportion
   parameter to adjust the proportion of consensus weight and label
   frequency in computing mixing value. Finally, we proposed an approach
   named the label propagation algorithm with consensus weight (LPAcw), and
   the experimental results showed that the LPAcw could enhance
   considerably both the stability and the accuracy of community
   partitions.},

Title = {Parametric and Non-Parametric Clustering for Segmentation},
Booktitle = {BIOMEDICAL IMAGE PROCESSING},
Series = {Biological and Medical Physics Biomedical Engineering},
Year = {2011},
Pages = {227-250},
Abstract = {In this chapter, we contrast the medical image segmentation problem with
   general image segmentation and introduce several state-of-the-art
   segmentation techniques based on clustering. Specifically, we will
   consider two types of clustering, one parametric, and the other
   non-parametric, to group pixels into contiguous regions. In the first
   approach which is a statistical clustering scheme based on parametric
   Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs), we develop the basic formalism and add
   variations and extensions to include a priori knowledge or context of
   the task at hand. In this formalism, each cluster is modeled as a
   Gaussian in the feature space. Each model component (Gaussian) can be
   assigned a semantic meaning; its automated extraction can be translated
   to the detection of an important image region, its segmentation as well
   as its tracking in time. We will demonstrate the GMM approach for
   segmentation of MR brain images. This will illustrate how the use of
   statistical modeling tools, in particular unsupervised clustering using
   Expectation-Maximization (EM) and modeling the image content via GM M,
   provides for robust tissue segmentation as well as brain lesion
   detection, segmentation and tracking in time. In the second approach, we
   take a non-parameterized graph-theoretic clustering approach to
   segmentation, and demonstrate how spatio-temporal features could be used
   to improve graphical clustering. In this approach, the image information
   is represented as a graph and the image segmentation task is positioned
   as a graph partitioning problem. A global criterion for graph
   partitioning based on normalized cuts is used. However, the weights of
   the edges now reflect spatio-temporal similarity between pixels. We
   derive a robust way of estimating temporal (motion) information in such
   imagery using a variant of Demon's algorithm. This approach will be
   illustrated in the domain of cardiac echo videos as an example of moving
   medical imagery.},

Title = {Variable space hidden Markov model for topic detection and analysis},

Volume = {20},

Abstract = {Discovering topics from large amount of documents has become an
   important task recently. Most of the topic models treat document as a
   word sequence, whether in discrete character or term frequency form.
   However, the number of words in a document is greatly different from
   that in other documents. This will lead to several problems for current
   topic models in dealing with topics analysis. On the other hand, it is
   difficult to perform topic transition analysis based on current topic
   models. In an attempt to overcome these deficiencies, a variable space
   hidden Markov model (VSHMM) is proposed to represent the topics, and
   several operations based on space computation are presented. A
   hierarchical clustering algorithm with dynamically changing of the
   component number in topic model is proposed to demonstrate the
   effectiveness of the VSHMM. Method of document partition based on topic
   transition is also present. Experiments on a real-world dataset show
   that the VSHMM can improve the accuracy while decreasing the algorithm's
   time complexity greatly compared with the algorithm based on current
   mixture model. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Cybercrime is a kind of criminal activity generally committed by
   cybercriminals or hackers. Crime activities are growing explosively all
   over the world which motivates the law enforcement agencies for
   systematic analysis of crimes. In many cases, crime information is
   stored as online text reports in an unstructured way and one report
   describes several different criminal activities. Analysis of these crime
   reports for identifying patterns and trends in crime and devising
   solutions to crime detection and prevention strategies are very
   challenging tasks. In this paper, the crime reports are preprocessed and
   relations among named entity pairs are extracted to give the structured
   form to the reports. Each extracted relation is converted to an
   n-dimensional real-valued vector based on the concept of Word2Vec model
   of Natural Language Processing. Then a novel agglomerative graph
   partitioning algorithm using various graph centrality measures is
   applied to partition the extracted relations. All the extracted
   relations of a report which are in a single partition are replaced by
   the representative of that partition and thus each report is described
   by a set of distinct types of relations. Next, a graph for the set of
   reports is constructed in such a way that nodes are corresponding to the
   tuple of relations that describes the reports, and an edge between a
   pair of nodes is drawn only if the corresponding pair of relations are
   of a similar type of two different reports. The constructed graph is a
   disconnected graph with each connected component is a clique. These
   cliques are easily identified in linear time of the number of edges in
   the graph and each clique provides a cluster of reports. As each report
   is described by a set of relations of different types, so obtained
   clusters are overlapping clusters. The degree of membership of a report
   in a cluster is also identified in the paper. The proposed method is
   experimented, and compared with some state-of-the-art partition-based
   and overlapping clustering algorithms to demonstrate its effectiveness
   in the domain of crime corpora. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {Ordering of trajectories reveals hierarchical finite-time coherent sets
   in Lagrangian particle data: detecting Agulhas rings in the South

Abstract = {The detection of finite-time coherent particle sets in Lagrangian
   trajectory data, using data-clustering techniques, is an active research
   field at the moment. Yet, the clustering methods mostly employed so far
   have been based on graph partitioning, which assigns each trajectory to
   a cluster, i.e. there is no concept of noisy, incoherent trajectories.
   This is problematic for applications in the ocean, where many small,
   coherent eddies are present in a large, mostly noisy fluid flow. Here,
   for the first time in this context, we use the density-based clustering
   algorithm of OPTICS (ordering points to identify the clustering
   structure; Ankerst et al., 1999) to detect finite-time coherent particle
   sets in Lagrangian trajectory data. Different from partition-based
   clustering methods, derived clustering results contain a concept of
   noise, such that not every trajectory needs to be part of a cluster.
   OPTICS also has a major advantage compared to the previously used
   density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN)
   method, as it can detect clusters of varying density. The resulting
   clusters have an intrinsically hierarchical structure, which allows one
   to detect coherent trajectory sets at different spatial scales at once.
   We apply OPTICS directly to Lagrangian trajectory data in the Bickley
   jet model flow and successfully detect the expected vortices and the
   jet. The resulting clustering separates the vortices and the jet from
   background noise, with an imprint of the hierarchical clustering
   structure of coherent, small-scale vortices in a coherent, large-scale
   background flow. We then apply our method to a set of virtual
   trajectories released in the eastern South Atlantic Ocean in an eddying
   ocean model and successfully detect Agulhas rings. We illustrate the
   difference between our approach and partition-based k-means clustering
   using a 2D embedding of the trajectories derived from classical
   multidimensional scaling. We also show how OPTICS can be applied to the
   spectral embedding of a trajectory-based network to overcome the
   problems of k-means spectral clustering in detecting Agulhas rings.},

Title = {A Spatio-Temporal Local Association Query Algorithm for Multi-Source
   Remote Sensing Big Data},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {It is extremely important to extract valuable information and achieve
   efficient integration of remote sensing data. The multi-source and
   heterogeneous nature of remote sensing data leads to the increasing
   complexity of these relationships, and means that the processing mode
   based on data ontology cannot meet requirements any more. On the other
   hand, the multi-dimensional features of remote sensing data bring more
   difficulties in data query and analysis, especially for datasets with a
   lot of noise. Therefore, data quality has become the bottleneck of data
   value discovery, and a single batch query is not enough to support the
   optimal combination of global data resources. In this paper, we propose
   a spatio-temporal local association query algorithm for remote sensing
   data (STLAQ). Firstly, we design a spatio-temporal data model and a
   bottom-up spatio-temporal correlation network. Then, we use the method
   of partition-based clustering and the method of spectral clustering to
   measure the correlation between spatio-temporal correlation networks.
   Finally, we construct a spatio-temporal index to provide joint query
   capabilities. We carry out local association query efficiency
   experiments to verify the feasibility of STLAQ on multi-scale datasets.
   The results show that the STLAQ weakens the barriers between remote
   sensing data, and improves their application value effectively.},

Abstract = {The applicability of generalized stochastic Petri nets (GSPNs) and other
   high-level modeling formalisms to real systems is often constrained by
   the explosion in the size of the underlying state-space representation.
   This paper describes a distributed program taking advantage of the large
   amount of memory and powerful computational resources of distributed
   computing systems to enable the construction of large state-space graphs
   generated by GSPN models. High state-space cardinalities and significant
   speedup with respect to sequential techniques are achieved by means of
   state space partitioning based on a distributed hashing function. The
   main algorithmic characteristics (global and local hashing and buffering
   of messages) are analyzed in detail and their effects are assessed by
   means of performance measurements on a PC cluster and a Gray T3D
   parallel machine. Performance results emphasize the good scalability
   with the number of processors of the proposed approach. even without
   East interconnection networks, While the distributed reachability graph
   construction technique has been conceived for GSPN solution. the issues
   raised are relevant to other modeling systems whose common trait is the
   generation of state spaces with irregular and a priori unknown
   structure. (C) 2001 Academic Press.},

Abstract = {We treat streamline selection and viewpoint selection as symmetric
   problems which are formulated into a unified information-theoretic
   framework. This is achieved by building two interrelated information
   channels between a pool of candidate streamlines and a set of sample
   viewpoints. We define the streamline information to select best
   streamlines and in a similar manner, define the viewpoint information to
   select best viewpoints. Furthermore, we propose solutions to streamline
   clustering and viewpoint partitioning based on the representativeness of
   streamlines and viewpoints, respectively. Finally, we define a camera
   path that passes through all selected viewpoints for automatic flow
   field exploration. We demonstrate the robustness of our approach by
   showing experimental results with different flow data sets, and
   conducting rigorous comparisons between our algorithm and other seed
   placement or streamline selection algorithms based on information

Abstract = {A bicluster of a gene expression dataset is a subset of genes which
   exhibit similar expression patterns along a subset of conditions. Given
   a gene expression matrix, we search for submatrices that are tightly
   coregulated according to some scoring criterion. We do not require the
   identified submatrices to be disjoint or to cover the entire matrix;
   instead we wish to build a diverse collection of submatrices that will
   capture all the significant signals in gene expression data. We believe
   that the size of the bicluster should be small compared to the size of
   the gene expression data matrix. So our approach finds biclusters by
   starting from small tightly co-regulated submatrices and adding more
   rows and columns to them. Our algorithm has three steps. First, we
   generate a set of high quality bicluster seeds based on a partition
   based clustering technique. In the second phase, these bicluster seeds
   are enlarged by adding more genes and conditions. In the third phase, we
   find the p-values of the biclusters produced for statistical validation.},

Abstract = {In remote sensing, change detection is used in land use and cover
   analysis, forest or vegetation assessment and, flood monitoring.
   Although manual change detection is an option, the time required for it
   can be prohibitive. It is also highly subjective depending on the
   expertise of the analyst. Hence, the need for automated methods for such
   analysis tasks have emerged and thus gives rise to unsupervised machine
   learning algorithm. This paper analyzes the effectiveness of the three
   types of unsupervised Machine learning algorithms (MLAs) for change
   detection to detect the change in some of the dominant classes in an
   urban area, such as, vegetation, built-up and water bodies. Landsat 5 TM
   and Landsat 8 OLI imageries have been selected for a part of New Delhi
   and its nearby area. In this study, three indices namely Normalized
   Difference Builtup Index (NDBI), Modified Normalized Difference Water
   Index (MNDWI) and Modified Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (MSAVI(2))
   have been generated from the Landsat data. Three algorithms, namely,
   K-Means, FCM and EM have been used, since these represent three
   different concepts in machine learning category i.e. partition based,
   fuzzy and probability based respectively. The same have been implemented
   in MATLAB for identifying different type of land cover over a period of
   1998-2011. Considering both the intra-and inter-cluster distances,
   silhouette coefficients have been used for evaluation of cluster
   quality. The change is quantified in terms of percentage that depends
   upon the outcome of clustering and the number of pixel grouped in each
   class i.e. urban, vegetation and water.},

Abstract = {As the number of networked computers grows, intrusion detection becomes
   an essential component in keeping networks secure. Various approaches
   for intrusion detection are currently being in use with each one has its
   own merits and demerits. This paper presents the work to test and
   improve the performance of an intrusion detection system based on
   C-fuzzy decision tree, a new class of decision tree. The tree grows
   gradually by using fuzzy C-means clustering (FCM) algorithm to split the
   patterns in a selected node with the maximum heterogeneity into C
   corresponding children nodes. We investigated the usefulness of C-fuzzy
   decision tree for developing IDS with a data partition based on
   horizontal fragmentation. Emphirical results indicate the usefulness of
   our approach in developing the efficient IDS. This paper also used a
   modified fuzzy C-means algorithm with controllable membership ratio
   through an extended distance measure to include an additional higher
   order term. Effect of different membership ratio on the developed
   decision tree with each fragment is tested to select the best membership
   ratio. The results obtained have shown that our improved version
   performs better resulting in an effective intrusion detection system.},

Abstract = {Adaptive random testing (ART) subsumes a family of random testing
   techniques with an effective improvement. It is based on the observation
   that failure causing inputs tend to be clustered together. Hence the ART
   methods spread test cases more evenly within the input domain to improve
   the fault-detection capability of random testing. There have been
   several implementations of ART based on different intuitions and
   principles with their own advantages and disadvantages. In the different
   variants of ART methods, the majority of them use a variety of distance
   calculations, with corresponding computational overhead. The newly
   methods try to decrease computational overhead while maintaining the
   performance through partitioning the input domain. We outline a new
   partitioning-based ART algorithm with a hybrid search method and
   demonstrate experimentally that it can further improve the performance,
   with considerably lower overhead than other ART algorithms.},

Abstract = {In this paper we consider the problem of k-partitioning the nodes of a
   graph with capacity restrictions on the sum of the node wrights in each

   costs of the edges between the subsets of the partition. Based on a
   study of valid inequalities. we present a variety of separation
   heuristics for cycle, cycle with ears, knapsack tree and path-block
   cycle inequalities among others. The separation heuristics, plus primal
   heuristics, have been implemented in a branch-and-cut routine using a
   formulation including variables for the edges with nonzero costs and
   node partition variables. Results are presented for three classes of
   problems: equipartitioning problems arising in finite element methods

Abstract = {To solve the voltage stability problem of electric vehicles connected to
   the distribution network in the limit state, a reactive power
   compensation strategy based on the holomorphic embedding method and
   electrical distance is proposed. Firstly, the load model of the electric
   vehicle charging station is constructed, and the limit of the charging
   power of the electric vehicle connected to a certain bus is obtained.
   Then, the power flow embedding equation of the power system is
   constructed by the holomorphic embedding method, and the analytical
   expression of the voltage rational function is introduced based on the
   Pade approximation algorithm. The voltage collapse point is solved by
   the distribution of zeros and poles of the rational function. Then, a
   method of reactive power and voltage control partition based on
   electrical distance is proposed. According to the principle of weak
   regional coupling and strong interval coupling, the power system is
   divided into several regions by spectral clustering and a k-means
   clustering algorithm. The order of the voltage stability margin value s
   is obtained by connecting the limit charging power to each bus of the
   power system. In this paper, the reactive power compensation strategy
   proposes to add reactive power compensation devices to the buses with
   the weakest voltage stability margin in different zones. Finally,
   compared with other reactive power compensation strategies 1 and 2, the
   reactive power compensation strategy provided in this paper is increased
   by 1.626121813 and 1.160494345 times, respectively. The superiority of
   this method is verified by simulation.},

Abstract = {The Minimum Interference Frequency Assignment Problem (MI-FAP) is an
   important optimization problem that arises in operational wireless
   networks. Solution techniques based on meta-heuristic algorithms have
   been shown to be successful for some test problems. How ever, they have
   not been demonstrated on the large scale problems that occur in
   practice, and their performance is poor in these cases. We propose a
   decomposed assignment technique which divides the initial problem into a
   number of simpler subproblems that are solved either independently or in
   sequence. Partial subproblems solutions are recomposed into a solution
   of the original problem. Our results, show that the decomposed
   assignment approach proposed can improve the outcomes, both in terms of
   solution quality and runtime. A number of partitioning methods are
   presented and compared, such as clique detection; partitioning based on
   sequential orderings; and novel applications of existing graph
   partitioning and clustering methods adapted for this problem.},

Abstract = {Tensile tests on miniature spruce specimens have been performed by means
   of acoustic emission (AE) analysis. Stress was applied perpendicular
   (radial direction) and parallel to the grain. Nine features were
   selected from the AE frequency spectra. The signals were classified by
   means of an unsupervised pattern recognition approach, and natural
   classes of AE signals were identified based on the selected features.
   The algorithm calculates the numerically best partition based on subset
   combinations of the features provided for the analysis and leads to the
   most significant partition including the respective feature combination
   and the most probable number of clusters. For both specimen types
   investigated, the pattern recognition technique indicates two AE signal
   clusters. Cluster A comprises AE signals with a relatively high share of
   low-frequency components, and the opposite is true for cluster B. It is
   hypothesized that the signature of rapid and slow crack growths might be
   the origin for this cluster formation.},

Title = {MapReduce based parallel attribute reduction in Incomplete Decision
   Systems},
Journal = {KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {213},
Month = {FEB 15},
Abstract = {The scale of the data collected today from applications in the
   real-world is massive. Sometimes this data can also include missing
   (incomplete) values that give rise to large-scale incomplete decision
   systems (IDS). Parallel attribute reduction in big data is an essential
   preprocessing step for scalable machine learning model construction.
   Rough set theory has been used as a powerful tool for attribute
   reduction in complete decision systems (CDS). Furthermore extensions to
   classical rough set theory have been proposed to deal with IDS. A lot of
   research works have been done on efficient attribute reduction in IDS
   using these extensions, but no parallel/distributed approaches have been
   proposed for attribute reduction in large-scale IDS. Since, owing to its
   two challenges, large-scale and incompleteness, the processing of
   large-scale IDS is difficult. To address these challenges, we propose
   MapReduce based parallel/distributed approaches for attribute reduction
   in massive IDS. The proposed approaches resolve the challenge of
   incompleteness with the existing Novel Granular Framework (NGF). And
   each proposed approach follows a different data partitioning strategy to
   handle the data sets that are large-scale in terms of number of objects
   and attributes. One of the proposed approaches adopts an alternative
   representation of the NGF and uses a horizontal partitioning (division
   in object space) of the data to the nodes of cluster. Another approach
   embraces the existing NGF and uses a vertical partitioning (division in
   attribute space) of the data. Extensive experimental analysis carried
   out on various data sets with different percentages of incompleteness in
   the data. The experimental results show that the horizontal partitioning
   based approach performs well for the massive object space data sets. And
   the vertical partitioning based approach is relevant and scales well for
   extremely high dimensional data sets. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {We propose partitioning-based methods to facilitate the classification
   of 3-D binary image data sets of regions of interest (ROIs) with highly
   non-uniform distributions. The first method is based on recursive
   dynamic partitioning of a 3-D volume into a number of 3-D
   hyper-rectangles. For each hyper-rectangle, we consider, as a potential
   attribute, the number of voxels (volume elements) that belong to ROIs. A
   hyper-rectangle is partitioned only if the corresponding attribute does
   not have high discriminative power, determined by statistical tests, but
   it is still sufficiently large for further splitting. The final
   discriminative hyper-rectangles form new attributes that are further
   employed in neural network classification models. The second method is
   based on maximum likelihood employing non-spatial (k-means) and spatial
   DBSCAN clustering algorithms to estimate the parameters of the
   underlying distributions. The proposed methods were experimentally
   evaluated on mixtures of Gaussian distributions, on realistic
   lesion-deficit data generated by a simulator conforming to a clinical
   study, and on synthetic fractal data. Both proposed methods have
   provided good classification on Gaussian mixtures and on realistic data.
   However. the experimental results on fractal data indicated that the
   clustering-based methods were only slightly better than random guess,
   while the recursive partitioning provided significantly better
   classification accuracy.},

Title = {Planning Strategies for Distributed PV-Storage Using a Distribution
   Network Based on Load Time Sequence Characteristics Partitioning},
Journal = {PROCESSES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {At present, due to the fact that large-scale distributed photovoltaics
   can access distribution networks and that there is a mismatch between
   load demand and photovoltaic output time, it is difficult for
   traditional distributed photovoltaic planning to meet the
   partition-based control of high permeability photovoltaic grid-connected
   operations. As a solution to this problem, this paper proposes a
   planning method for photovoltaic storage partitions. First of all, a
   partitioning method for electrical distance modularity based on
   voltage/active power and voltage/reactive power is presented, along with
   a modified AP-TD-K-medoids trilevel clustering algorithm that was
   designed to cluster and partition the distribution network. In addition,
   according to the partitioning results, a bilevel co-ordination planning
   model for distributed photovoltaic storage was developed. The upper
   level aimed to minimize the annual comprehensive cost for which the
   decision variables are the photovoltaic capacity, energy storage
   capacity, and power of each partition. The lower level aimed to minimize
   system network losses, and the decision variables for this are the
   photovoltaic installation capacity and energy storage installation
   location of the intrapartition node. Finally, we adopted the particle
   swarm algorithm with bilevel iterative adaptive weight to solve the
   planning model, and the simulation was carried out on the distribution
   system of the IEEE33 nodes. The results show the rationality of the
   model and the effectiveness of the solution method.},

Abstract = {Formal concept analysis (FCA) is a tool for extracting natural clusters
   from objects and attributes represented as a binary table. Several
   parallel and distributed algorithms have been proposed to speedup
   concept discovery. The replication-based approaches suffer from memory
   bottlenecks while dealing with large contexts, whereas the
   partitioning-based approaches incur huge communication overhead. We
   propose HyPar-FCA, a distributed framework that uses horizontal
   partitioning for low support attributes and vertical partitioning for
   high support attributes. Our hybrid partitioning strategy can be tuned
   according to the machines' memory constraints. It eliminates
   inter-machine communication for the horizontal partitions and minimizes
   it using auxiliary structures for the vertical partition. We show that
   HyPar-FCA is scalable to large contexts and can work on commodity
   hardware with memory constraints. Compared with state-of-the-art
   distributed FCA frameworks, HyPar-FCA improves execution time by 22\%
   and reduces memory usage by 27\%.},

Abstract = {Due to increasing rates of adoption of electric vehicles (EVs), there is
   a strong need to deploy the necessary charging station infrastructure,
   together with routing strategies to manage traffic flow and congestion.
   This study addresses the location-routing problem (LRP) for a general EV
   charging system with stochastic charging requests regarding their
   locations, arrival times and charging times. The objective is to develop
   an efficient routing strategy of EVs to charging stations, as well as to
   determine the optimal charging station locations so as to minimize the
   demand's mean response time. Under some regularity assumptions on the
   mean waiting time at each charging station (e.g. system operates in a
   light or heavy traffic regime), we show that the optimization problem
   can be formulated as a partition-based clustering problem with size
   constraints. This relaxation of the problem formulation enables us to
   develop a novel data-driven approach for solving the charging station
   LRP, without requiring detailed stochastic models for the EV's charging
   requests, as well as the queueing behavior of the charging stations. An
   algorithm along with two size adjustment strategies are developed to
   solve the obtained clustering problem and illustrated on urban areas of
   Seattle with various types of distance, vehicle speeds, distributions
   for charging request locations, and inter-arrival time densities.},

Abstract = {This paper is concerned with the problem of efficient processing of
   temporal join operation on temporal relation. By mapping time intervals
   to points in the plane, we first show that the problem of determining
   the set of all matching tuples of a temporal join is equivalent to the
   dominance searching problem in the plane. Then, by using an efficient
   data structure for solving the equivalent dominance searching problem as
   an index for the inner relation, We Propose a nested-loops temporal join
   algorithm. For the case where the index for the inner relations too
   large to fit in the primary memory, We Propose another partition-based
   temporal join algorithm which does not need any index for the operand
   relations. Finally, in order to provide more efficient processing of
   temporal join, we propose a Cluster scheme and an index scheme to
   support efficient storage of tuples and direct access of matching
   tuples.},

Abstract = {For a large training data set, the memory space required to store the
   kernel matrix is a difficult task for the solution of QP problems for
   SVR. Support Vector Regression (SVR) is used to approximate the
   function. So we are proposing the slope based partition algorithm, which
   automatically evolves the partitions based on change in slope. In this
   paper we are improving the performance of function approximation with
   SVM by preprocessing the dataset with Fuzzy c-Mean clustering (FCM) and
   slope based partition methods. Using FCM and slope, we are portioning
   the data, and for every partitioned dataset we are finding the function
   approximation, and aggregating the result. The results indicate that
   Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) has been reduced with the partitioned
   data, compare to the processing entire dataset, with the increase in
   performance approximately 40\%},

Title = {Cluster Identification Using Modularity Optimization to Uncover Chemical
   Heterogeneity in Complex Solutions},

Pages = {3986-3993},

Abstract = {Structural heterogeneity is commonly manifested in solutions and liquids
   that feature competition of different interparticle forces. Identifying
   and characterizing heterogeneity across different length scales requires
   multimodal experimental measurement and/or the application of new
   techniques for the interrogation of atomistic simulation data. Within
   the latter, the parsing of networks of interparticle interactions
   (chemical networks) has been demonstrated to be a valuable tool for
   identifying subensembles of chemical environments. However, chemical
   networks can adopt a wide variety of topologies that challenge
   generalizable methods for identifying heterogeneous behavior, and few
   network analysis algorithms have been proposed for multiscale
   resolution. In this study, we apply a method of partitioning using the
   graph theoretic concept of clusters and communities. Using a modularity
   optimization algorithm, the cluster partition creates subgraphs based on
   their relative internal and external connectivities. The methodology is
   tested on two soft matter systems that have significantly different
   network topologies so as to probe its ability to identify multiple scale
   features and its generalizability. A binary Lennard-Jones fluid is first
   examined, where one component causes subgraphs that have high internal
   network connectivity yet are still connected to the rest of the
   interparticle network of interactions. The impact of connectivity and
   edge weighting on the cluster partition is investigated. In the second
   system, hierarchically organized molecular structures comprised of
   hydrogen bonded water molecules are identified at a liquid/liquid
   interface. These structures have a much more sparse network with
   significantly varied internal connectivity that is a challenge to
   differentiate from the background hydrogen bonding network of water
   molecules at the instantaneous interface. The organized macrostructures
   are effectively isolated from the background network using the cluster
   partition, and a time-dependent implementation allows us to reveal their
   reactivity. These studies indicate that cluster partitioning based upon
   intermolecular network connectivity patterns is broadly generalizable,
   depending only on user-defined intermolecular connectivity, is operable
   across different length scales, and is extensible to the study of
   dynamic phenomena.},

Abstract = {Due to the famous dimensionality curse problem, search in a
   high-dimensional space is considered as a ``hard{''} problem. In this
   paper, a novel composite distance transformation method, which is called
   CDT, is proposed to support a fast k-nearest-neighbor (k-NN) search in
   high-dimensional spaces. In CDT, all (n) data points are first grouped
   into some clusters by a k-Means clustering algorithm. Then a composite
   distance key of each data point is computed. Finally, these index keys
   of such n data points are inserted by a partition-based B+-tree. Thus,
   given a query point, its k-NN search in high-dimensional spaces is
   transformed into the search in the single dimensional space with the aid
   of CDT index. Extensive performance studies are conducted to evaluate
   the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed scheme. Our results
   show that this method outperforms the state-of-the-art high-dimensional
   search techniques, such as the X-Tree, VA-file, iDistance and NB-Tree.},

   transmission of 3D point sets. In order to reduce memory loads for huge
   point sets on general PC platforms, we introduce a partition-based
   out-of-core strategy to balance usage of main and external memories. At
   first, the data surface is partitioned into small blocks and points in
   each block are reorganized into error-controlled LODs by hierarchical
   clustering and LOD organization. In the interactive rendering process, a
   data block scheduling algorithm is used to realize the view-dependent
   paging. Experimental results show that the viewer can perform
   interactive visualization of huge point models on commodity graphics
   platforms with ease.},

Title = {MCO Plan: Efficient Coverage Mission for Multiple Micro Aerial Vehicles
   Modeled as Agents},
Journal = {DRONES},
Year = {2022},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Micro aerial vehicle (MAV) fleets have gained essential recognition in
   the decision schemes for precision agriculture, disaster management, and
   other coverage missions. However, they have some challenges in becoming
   massively deployed. One of them is resource management in restricted
   workspaces. This paper proposes a plan to balance resources when
   considering the practical use of MAVs and workspace in daily chores. The
   coverage mission plan is based on five stages: world abstraction, area
   partitioning, role allocation, task generation, and task allocation. The
   tasks are allocated according to agent roles, Master, Coordinator, or
   Operator (MCO), which describe their flight autonomy, connectivity, and
   decision skill. These roles are engaged with the partitioning based on
   the Voronoi-tessellation but extended to heterogeneous polygons. The
   advantages of the MCO Plan were evident compared with conventional
   Boustrophedon decomposition and clustering by K-means. The MCO plan
   achieved a balanced magnitude and trend of heterogeneity between both
   methods, involving MAVs with few or intermediate resources. The
   resulting efficiency was tested in the GAMA platform, with gained energy
   between 2\% and 10\% in the mission end. In addition, the MCO plan
   improved mission times while the connectivity was effectively held, even
   more, if the Firefly algorithm generated coverage paths.},

Abstract = {Clustering is one of the most important techniques in machine learning
   and data mining responsibilities. Similar documents are grouped by
   performing clustering techniques. Similarity measure is used to
   determine transaction associations. Hierarchical clustering method
   produces tree structured results. Partition based clustering model
   produces the results in grid format. Text documents are formless data
   values with high dimensional attributes. Document clustering group the
   unlabeled text documents into meaningful clusters. Traditionally
   clustering methods need cluster count (K) before the document grouping
   process. Clustering accuracy decreases drastically with reference to the
   unsuitable cluster count. Document word features are automatically
   partitioned into two groups discriminative words and non-discriminative
   words. But only discriminative words are useful for grouping documents.
   The contribution of nondiscriminative words confuses the clustering
   process and leads to poor cluster solutions. The variational inference
   algorithm is used to infer the document collection structure and
   partition of document words at the same time. Dirichlet Process Mixture
   (DPM) model is used to partition documents. DPM clustering model
   utilizes both the data likelihood and the clustering property of the
   Dirichlet Process (DP). Dirichlet Process Mixture Model for Feature
   Partition (DPMFP) is used to discover the latent cluster structure based
   on the DPM model. DPMFP clustering model is performed without requiring
   the no. of clusters as input. The Discriminative word identification
   process is enhanced with the labeled document analysis mechanism. The
   concept relationships are analyzed with Ontology support. Semantic
   weight analysis is used for the document similarity measure. This method
   increases the scalability with the support of labels and concept
   relations for dimensionality cutback process.},

Abstract = {Given a data point set D, a query point set Q, and an integer k, the
   Group Nearest Group (GNG) query finds a subset omega (vertical bar omega
   vertical bar <= k) of points from D such that the total distance from
   all points in Q to the nearest point in omega is not greater than any
   other subset omega' (vertical bar omega'vertical bar <= k) of points in
   D. GNG query is a partition-based clustering problem which can be found
   in many real applications and is NP-hard. In this paper, Exhaustive
   Hierarchical Combination (EHC) algorithm and Subset Hierarchial
   Refinement (SHR) algorithm are developed for GNG query processing. While
   EHC is capable to provide the optimal solution for k = 2, SHR is an
   efficient approximate approach that combines database techniques with
   local search heuristic. The processing focus of our approaches is on
   minimizing the access and evaluation of subsets of cardinality k in D
   since the number of such subsets is exponentially greater than vertical
   bar D vertical bar. To do that, the hierarchical blocks of data points
   at high level are used to find an intermediate solution and then refined
   by following the guided search direction at low level so as to prune
   irrelevant subsets. The comprehensive experiments on both real and
   synthetic data sets demonstrate the superiority of SHR in terms of
   efficiency and quality.},

Title = {Data-Driven Approach Toward Airspace Design for Regional Air Mobility
   Operations in Korea},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF AEROSPACE INFORMATION SYSTEMS},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUN 6},
Abstract = {As the Korean government agencies have recently announced the first
   official road map for urban air mobility (UAM) with the aim of
   introducing a new aviation transportation system, many companies in
   South Korea have initiated projects to design airspace infrastructure
   for UAM operations at the early stage of development. Given that the
   agencies tentatively plan to expand UAM to regional air mobility (RAM)
   operations at the mature stage of development, this research
   specifically focuses on establishing airspace infrastructure for
   upcoming RAM operations in South Korea. The proposed methodology
   leverages three different algorithms: 1) a partitioning-based clustering
   algorithm for placing vertiport locations, 2) a density-based clustering
   algorithm for predicting areas of convective weather, and 3) the Latin
   hypercube sampling-based probabilistic road map (LHS-based PRM)
   algorithm for generating an adaptive airspace network. The resulting
   airspace, constructed by the proposed methodology, takes into account
   airspace restriction areas such as prohibited areas or military
   operation areas. The main contribution of this research is to employ a
   data-driven approach using machine learning and LHS-based PRM algorithms
   to dynamically establish airspace infrastructure to be potentially used
   for upcoming RAM operations in South Korea.},

Abstract = {The paper describes a modeling library for analysis and optimization of
   distributed service systems: enterprise computing infrastructures,
   E-commerce, and E-service systems. The library uses a small number of
   basic notions, such as service, server, cluster (of servers), clients
   and message, which allow describing, analyzing and optimizing various
   system configurations and distributions of services among servers. The
   service requests and responses are modeled by messages traveling in the
   system and using its common resources. Clients send their requests to
   servers, which either return responses or may issue secondary requests
   for other services. To find the optimal deployment of services among
   servers, different partition policies can be deployed including
   partitions based on genetic algorithms. The library is built on top of
   Communicating Structures Library (CSL), a modeling environment for
   large-scale distributed systems {[}1]. In its turn, Systems of Servers
   is a base for specialized libraries that target specific classes of

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Graph partitioning is an effective way to improve the performance of
   parallel computing. However, the research of graph partitioning is
   driven by the demand of practical applications. In this paper, we
   propose a streaming graph partitioning algorithm based on
   heterogeneous-aware for distributed heterogeneous computing environment.
   It not only considers the difference of network bandwidth and the
   compute ability of computer nodes, but also considers the shared
   resources competition between cores in a high-speed network. Taking
   breadth first search, single source shortest path and PageRank
   algorithms as examples, compared with the streaming algorithms without
   considering the heterogeneous environment, the efficiency of graph
   computing is improved on average by 38\%, 45.7\% and 61.8\%
   respectively. Meanwhile, in view of the low efficiency of streaming
   graph partitioning based on adjacent vertex structure, we design a cache
   management mechanism based on adjacent edge structure for streaming
   graph partitioning, which effectively improves the partitioning
   efficiency. The experimental results show that our method is suitable
   for graph vertex assignment in distributed heterogeneous cluster
   environment.},

Abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely used in the past few
   decades due to their high maneuverability. This paper studies a downlink
   UAV air-ground wireless network based on non-orthogonal multiple access
   (NOMA) technology, where a UAV is deployed as an aerial base station to
   provide periodic service for a group of users. With the purpose of
   maximizing the minimum sum rate of system in the limited time, an
   iterative algorithm for jointly optimizing user scheduling and UAV
   trajectory is proposed. In order to find the optimal users to
   communicate with, we present a method of user partitioning based on
   k-Means clustering algorithm and a strategy for selecting subset to
   schedule on the basis of NOMA technology. The maximum sum rate of edge
   users in the NOMA-based UAV communication system is also considered. The
   simulation results are provided to show the optimal UAV trajectories
   with different objective functions, and to indicate that the NOMA-based
   UAV system provides the benefits of achieving a better air-ground
   communication compared to OMA scheme and other benchmark schemes.},

Abstract = {The initial centroid is a fairly challenging problem in the k-means
   method because it can affect the clustering results. In addition,
   choosing the starting centroid of the cluster is not always appropriate,
   especially, when the number of groups increases. The random technique is
   often used to overcome this problem, but it produces a variety of
   solutions because the initial centroid initialization uses a random way.
   Therefore, we propose Distance Part's (DP) method to solve initial
   cluster initialization problems on the k-means method (DP-KMeans).
   DP-KMeans is a new approach for initial centroid; this approach works by
   way of data is partitioned based on the sorted data from largest to
   smallest value distance to the reference point. This method is called by
   DP-KMeans, because the data of partition is based on the sorted data
   distance to the reference point. In this study, four datasets by the UCI
   machine learning repository are used to evaluate the proposed method.

Title = {An novel frequent probability pattern mining algorithm based on circuit
   simulation method in uncertain biological networks},
Journal = {BMC SYSTEMS BIOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {8},
Number = {3},
Month = {OCT 22},
Abstract = {Background: Motif mining has always been a hot research topic in
   bioinformatics. Most of current research on biological networks focuses
   on exact motif mining. However, due to the inevitable experimental error
   and noisy data, biological network data represented as the probability
   model could better reflect the authenticity and biological significance,
   therefore, it is more biological meaningful to discover probability
   motif in uncertain biological networks. One of the key steps in
   probability motif mining is frequent pattern discovery which is usually
   based on the possible world model having a relatively high computational
   complexity.
   Methods: In this paper, we present a novel method for detecting frequent
   probability patterns based on circuit simulation in the uncertain
   biological networks. First, the partition based efficient search is
   applied to the non-tree like subgraph mining where the probability of
   occurrence in random networks is small. Then, an algorithm of
   probability isomorphic based on circuit simulation is proposed. The
   probability isomorphic combines the analysis of circuit topology
   structure with related physical properties of voltage in order to
   evaluate the probability isomorphism between probability subgraphs. The
   circuit simulation based probability isomorphic can avoid using
   traditional possible world model. Finally, based on the algorithm of
   probability subgraph isomorphism, two-step hierarchical clustering
   method is used to cluster subgraphs, and discover frequent probability
   patterns from the clusters.
   Results: The experiment results on data sets of the Protein-Protein
   Interaction (PPI) networks and the transcriptional regulatory networks
   of E. coli and S. cerevisiae show that the proposed method can
   efficiently discover the frequent probability subgraphs. The discovered
   subgraphs in our study contain all probability motifs reported in the
   experiments published in other related papers.
   Conclusions: The algorithm of probability graph isomorphism evaluation
   based on circuit simulation method excludes most of subgraphs which are
   not probability isomorphism and reduces the search space of the
   probability isomorphism subgraphs using the mismatch values in the node
   voltage set. It is an innovative way to find the frequent probability
   patterns, which can be efficiently applied to probability motif
   discovery problems in the further studies.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we consider two approaches of simplifying medium- and
   large-sized range datasets to a compact data point set, based on the
   Radial Basis Functions (RBF) approximation. The first algorithm uses a
   Pseudo-Inverse Approach for the case of given basis functions, and the
   second one uses an SVD-Based Approach for the case of unknown basis
   functions. The novelty of this paper consists in a novel partition-based
   SVD algorithm for a symmetric square matrix, which can effectively
   reduce the dimension of a matrix in a given partition case. Furthermore,
   this algorithm is combined with a standard clustering algorithm to form
   our SVD-Based Approach, which can then seek an appropriate partition
   automatically for dataset simplification. Experimental results indicate
   that the presented Pseudo-Inverse Approach requires a uniform sampled
   control point set, and can obtain an optimal least square solution in
   the given control point set case. While in the unknown control point
   case, the presented SVD-Based Approach can seek an appropriate control
   point set automatically, and the resulting surface preserves more of the
   essential details and is prone to less distortions.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we introduce a novel graph-based method to classify the
   regions with similar climate in a local area. We refer our proposed
   method as graph partition based method (GPBM). Our proposed method
   attempts to overcome the shortcomings of the current state-of-the-art
   methods in the literature. It has no limit on the number of variables
   that can be used and also preserves the nature of climate data. To
   illustrate the capability of our proposed algorithm, we benchmark its
   performance with other state-of-the-art climate classification
   techniques. The climate data are collected from 24 synoptic stations in
   Fars province in southern Iran. The data include seven climate variables
   stored as time series from 1951 to 2017. Our results exhibit that our
   proposed method performs a more realistic climate classification with
   less computational time. It can save more information during the climate
   classification process and is therefore efficient in further data
   analysis. Furthermore, using our method, we can introduce seasonal
   graphs to better investigate seasonal climate changes. To the best of
   our knowledge, our proposed method is the first graph-based climate
   classification system.},

Abstract = {We propose a Partition-based Visibility (PV) graph modeling to find the
   minimum number of Visible Light Communications (VLC) nodes and their
   locations for reliable indoor coverage. VLC network offers a low-cost
   technology on a license-free spectrum to complement the contemporary
   mobile network services offered on Radio Frequency (RF) bands. However,
   VLC suffers from propagation limits: Firstly, in presence of opaque
   obstacles such as walls, doors, and even curtains, strong link blockage
   is experienced as the power of reflections is much weaker than the power
   of the Line-of-Sight (LoS) link. Secondly, the received optical power at
   users drops as the angle of irradiance between a LED lamp and the user
   increases, imposing a range constraint on the VLC nodes. So, inspired by
   the Art Gallery Problem, we optimize the number and the locations of VLC
   nodes by characterizing the PV graph as a dual presentation of the floor
   plan and a Maximal Clique Clustering algorithm, which is able to solve
   not only the art gallery problem but also to extend the approach for the
   range constrained case.},

Abstract = {Pattern analysis of human motions, which is useful in many research
   areas, requires understanding and comparison of different styles of
   motion patterns. However, working with human motion tracking data to
   support such analysis poses great challenges. In this paper, we propose
   Motion Flow, a visual analytics system that provides an effective
   overview of various motion patterns based on an interactive flow
   visualization. This visualization formulates a motion sequence as
   transitions between static poses, and aggregates these sequences into a
   tree diagram to construct a set of motion patterns. The system also
   allows the users to directly reflect the context of data and their
   perception of pose similarities in generating representative pose
   states. We provide local and global controls over the partition-based
   clustering process. To support the users in organizing unstructured
   motion data into pattern groups, we designed a set of interactions that
   enables searching for similar motion sequences from the data, detailed
   exploration of data subsets, and creating and modifying the group of
   motion patterns. To evaluate the usability of Motion Flow, we conducted
   a user study with six researchers with expertise in gesture-based
   interaction design. They used Motion Flow to explore and organize
   unstructured motion tracking data. Results show that the researchers
   were able to easily learn how to use Motion Flow, and the system
   effectively supported their pattern analysis activities, including
   leveraging their perception and domain knowledge.},

   for scalable supervised training},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BIG DATA},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {6},
Number = {1},
Month = {OCT 31},
Abstract = {A scalable graphical method is presented for selecting and partitioning
   datasets for the training phase of a classification task. For the
   heuristic, a clustering algorithm is required to get its computation
   cost in a reasonable proportion to the task itself. This step is
   succeeded by construction of an information graph of the underlying
   classification patterns using approximate nearest neighbor methods. The
   presented method consists of two approaches, one for reducing a given
   training set, and another for partitioning the selected/reduced set. The
   heuristic targets large datasets, since the primary goal is a
   significant reduction in training computation run-time without
   compromising prediction accuracy. Test results show that both approaches
   significantly speed-up the training task when compared against that of
   state-of-the-art shrinking heuristics available in LIBSVM. Furthermore,
   the approaches closely follow or even outperform in prediction accuracy.
   A network design is also presented for a partitioning based distributed
   training formulation. Added speed-up in training run-time is observed
   when compared to that of serial implementation of the approaches.},

Volume = {2},
Pages = {897-908},
Abstract = {This paper proposes a novel graph-based multicell scheduling framework
   to efficiently mitigate downlink intercell interference in OFDMA-based
   small cell networks. We define a graph-based optimization framework
   based on interference condition between any two users in the network
   assuming they are served on similar resources. Furthermore, we prove
   that the proposed framework obtains a tight lower bound for conventional
   weighted sum-rate maximization problem in practical scenarios.
   Thereafter, we decompose the optimization problem into dynamic
   graph-partitioning-based subproblems across different subchannels and
   provide an optimal solution using branch-and-cut approach. Subsequently,
   due to high complexity of the solution, we propose heuristic algorithms
   that display near optimal performance. At the final stage, we apply
   cluster-based resource allocation per subchannel to find candidate users
   with maximum total weighted sum-rate. A case study on networked small
   cells is also presented with simulation results showing a significant
   improvement over the state-of-the-art multicell scheduling benchmarks in
   terms of outage probability as well as average cell throughput.},

Abstract = {Nearest neighbor search has a wide variety of applications.
   Unfortunately, the majority of search methods do not scale well with
   dimensionality. Recent efforts have been focused on finding better
   approximate solutions that improve the locality of data using
   dimensionality reduction. However, it is possible to preserve the
   locality of data and find exact nearest neighbors in high dimensions
   without dimensionality reduction. This paper introduces a novel
   high-performance technique to find exact k-nearest neighbors in both low
   and high dimensional spaces. It relies on a new method for
   data-sensitive space partitioning based on explicit data clustering,
   which is introduced in the paper for the first time. This organization
   supports effective reduction of the search space before accessing
   secondary storage. Costly Euclidean distance calculations are reduced
   through efficient processing of a lightweight memory-based filter. The
   algorithm outperforms sequential scan and the VA-File in
   high-dimensional situations. Moreover, the results with dynamic loading
   of data show that the technique works well on dynamic datasets as well.},

   provides a service of evaluating national R\&D projects and providing
   such evaluated national R\&D projects along with their participating
   researcher information. It also provides a service of recommending and
   selecting evaluation committees for the R\&D projects. Transparency is
   an important aspect that should be ensured on the evaluation process of
   the national R\&D projects. Thus, the recommending unfamiliar evaluation
   committees with the participants of the R\&D projects are one of the
   important aspects that can ensure the transparency for the evaluation
   process. In this paper, we present an evaluation-committee
   recommendation system using an online detection method of researcher
   connections by a partitioning-based clustering algorithm and random
   walks. The clustering algorithm enables us to partition the network to
   number of small graphs that can be processed via random walks. Then, we
   can rank the connection weight of each suspicious researcher according
   to a researcher in charge of a R\&D project and we can exclude the
   researchers having higher connection weight from the evaluation
   committee of the R\&D project. In addition, we also present a text-data
   refinement and entity identification method using Jaro-Winkler distance
   algorithm to construct more precise researcher network.},

Title = {Node2vec with weak supervision on community structures},
Journal = {PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {150},
Pages = {147-154},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Detecting communities or the modular structure of real-life networks
   (e.g. a social network or a prod-uct purchase network) is an important
   task because the way a network functions is often determined by its
   communities. Traditional approaches to community detection involve
   modularity-based algorithms, which generally speaking, construct
   partitions based on heuristics that seek to maximize the ratio of the
   edges within the partitions to those between them. On the other hand,
   node embedding approaches represent each node in a graph as a
   real-valued vector and is thereby able to transform the problem of
   community detection in a graph to that of clustering a set of vectors.
   Existing node embedding ap-proaches are primarily based on, first,
   initiating random walks from each node to construct a context of a node,
   and then make the vector representation of a node close to its context.
   However, standard node embedding approaches do not directly take into
   account the community structure of a network while constructing the
   context around each node. To alleviate this, we propose a community
   structure aware node embedding approach, where we incorporate an initial
   combinatorial approach-based partition infor-mation into the objective
   function of node embedding. We demonstrate that our proposed combination
   of the combinatorial and the embedding approaches for community
   detection outperforms a number of combinatorial-based baselines on a
   wide range of real-life and synthetic networks of different sizes and
   densities. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Functional Influence-Based Approach to Identify Overlapping Modules in
   Biological Networks},
Booktitle = {LINK MINING: MODELS, ALGORITHMS, AND APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2010},
Pages = {535-556},
Abstract = {The inherent, dynamic, and structural behaviors of complex biological
   networks in a topological perspective have been widely studied recently.
   These studies have attempted to discover hidden functional knowledge on
   a system level since biological networks provide insights into the
   underlying mechanisms of biological processes and molecular functions
   within a cell. Functional modules can be identified from biological
   networks as a sub-network whose components are highly associated with
   each other through links. Conventional graph-theoretic algorithms had a
   limitation in efficiency and accuracy on functional modules detection
   because of complex connectivity and overlapping modules. Whereas
   partition-based or hierarchical clustering methods produce pairwise
   disjoint clusters, density-based clustering methods that search densely
   connected sub-networks are able to generate overlapping clusters.
   However, they are not well applicable to identifying functional modules
   from typically sparse biological networks. Recently proposed functional
   influence-based approach effectively handles the complex but sparse
   biological networks, generating large-sized overlapping modules. This
   approach is based on the functional influence model, which quantifies
   the influence of a source vertex on each target vertex. The experiment
   with a real protein interaction network in yeast shows that this
   approach has better performance than other competing methods. A better
   understanding of higher-order organizations that are identified by
   functional influence patterns in biological networks can be explored in
   many practical biomedical applications.},

Title = {Optimal partitioning of heterogeneous traffic sources in mobile

Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTERS},
Year = {1997},
Volume = {46},
Number = {3},
Pages = {312-325},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Given n heterogeneous traffic sources which generate multiple types of
   traffic among themselves, we consider the problem of finding a set of
   disjoint clusters to cover n traffic sources. The objective is to
   minimize the total communication cost for the entire system in the
   context that the intracluster communication is less expensive than the
   intercluster communication. Different from the general graph
   partitioning problem, our work takes into account the physical topology
   constraints of the linear arrangement of physical cells in highway
   cellular systems and the hexagonal mesh arrangement of physical cells in
   cellular systems. In our partitioning schemes, the optimal partitioning
   problem is transformed into an equivalent problem with a relative cost
   function, which generates the communication cost differences between the
   intracluster communications and the intercluster communications.
   For highway cellular systems, we have designed an efficient optimal
   partitioning algorithm of O(mn(2)) by dynamic programming, where m is
   the number of clusters of n base stations. The algorithm also finds all
   the valid partitions in the same polynomial time, given the size
   constraint on a cluster and the total allowable communication cost for
   the entire system. For hexagonal cellular systems, we have developed
   four heuristics for the optimal partitioning based on the techniques of
   moving or interchanging boundary nodes between adjacent clusters. The
   heuristics have been evaluated and compared through experimental testing
   and analysis.},

Title = {An encoding-based dual distance tree high-dimensional index},
Journal = {SCIENCE IN CHINA SERIES F-INFORMATION SCIENCES},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {51},
Number = {10},
Pages = {1401-1414},

Abstract = {The paper proposes a novel symmetrical encoding-based index structure,
   which is called EDD-tree (for encoding-based dual distance tree), to
   support fast k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) search in high-dimensional
   spaces. In the EDD-tree, all data points are first grouped into clusters
   by a k-means clustering algorithm. Then the uniform ID number of each
   data point is obtained by a dual-distance-driven encoding scheme, in
   which each cluster sphere is partitioned twice according to the dual
   distances of start- and centroid-distance. Finally, the uniform ID
   number and the centroid-distance of each data point are combined to get
   a uniform index key, the latter is then indexed through a
   partition-based B+-tree. Thus, given a query point, its k-NN search in
   high-dimensional spaces can be transformed into search in a single
   dimensional space with the aid of the EDD-tree index. Extensive
   performance studies are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness and
   efficiency of our proposed scheme, and the results demonstrate that this
   method outperforms the state-of-the-art high-dimensional search
   techniques such as the X-tree, VA-file, iDistance and NB-tree,
   especially when the query radius is not very large.},

Title = {Pornographic images recognition based on spatial pyramid partition and
   multi-instance ensemble learning},
Journal = {KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS},

Volume = {84},
Pages = {214-223},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {For tackling the problem of pornographic image recognition, a novel
   multi-instance learning (MIL) algorithm is proposed by using extreme
   learning machine (ELM) and classifiers ensemble. Firstly, a spatial
   pyramid partition-based (SPP) multi-instance modeling technique has been
   deployed to transform the pornographic images recognition problem into a
   typical MIL problem. The method has deployed a bag corresponding to an
   image and an instance corresponding to each partitioned sub-block
   described by low-level visual features (i.e. color, texture and shape).
   Secondly, a collection of visual word (VW) has been generated by using
   hierarchical k-mean clustering method, and then based on the fuzzy
   membership function between instance and VW, a fuzzy histogram
   fusion-based metadata Calculation method has been proposed to convert
   each bag to a single sample, which allows the MIL problem to be solved
   directly by a standard single instance learning (SIL) machine. Finally,
   by using ELM, a group of base classifiers with different number of
   hidden nodes have been constructed, and their weights bas been
   dynamically determined by using performance weighting rule. Therefore,
   the strategy of classifiers ensemble is used to improve the overall
   adaptability of proposed ELMCE-MIL algorithm. Experimental results have
   shown that the method is robust, and its performance is superior to
   other similar algorithms. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Effectively bridging between image level keyword annotations and
   corresponding image pixels is one of the main challenges in weakly
   supervised semantic segmentation. In this paper, we use an
   instance-level salient object detector to automatically generate salient
   instances (candidate objects) for training images. Using similarity
   features extracted from each salient instance in the whole training set,
   we build a similarity graph, then use a graph partitioning algorithm to
   separate it into multiple subgraphs, each of which is associated with a
   single keyword (tag). Our graph-partitioning-based clustering algorithm
   allows us to consider the relationships between all salient instances in
   the training set as well as the information within them. We further show
   that with the help of attention information, our clustering algorithm is
   able to correct certain wrong assignments, leading to more accurate
   results. The proposed framework is general, and any state-of-the-art
   fully-supervised network structure can be incorporated to learn the
   segmentation network. When working with DeepLab for semantic
   segmentation, our method outperforms state-of-the-art weakly supervised
   alternatives by a large margin, achieving 65.6\% mIoU on the PASCAL VOC
   2012 dataset. We also combine our method with Mask RCNN for instance
   segmentation, and demonstrated for the first time the ability of weakly
   supervised instance segmentation using only keyword annotations.},

Journal = {ANALYTICAL METHODS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {8},
Number = {39},
Pages = {7225-7231},
Abstract = {In order to a build robust and predictive model, all outliers should be
   eliminated and representative samples should be selected. In this study,
   Isolation forest Outlier detection and Subset selection (IOS) has been
   proposed, which can detect outliers and select representative subsets
   simultaneously. IOS is different from the classical subset selection
   method, which is cluster-based and has a uniform design. A comparative
   study among the IOS, Kennard-Stone (KS), sample set partitioning based
   on joint x-y distances (SPXY) and random sampling (RS) methods was
   conducted. The performances of these algorithms were benchmarked with
   four datasets, including two normal NIR datasets, which are free of
   outliers: soil and diesel fuel, and two datasets with outliers: milk NIR
   dataset and solubility QSAR dataset (LogS). Results show that IOS can
   detect outliers and select representative subsets of samples
   simultaneously, which reduces prediction errors significantly compared
   with the KS, SPXY and RS methods. IOS can eliminate outliers and select
   representative samples without y values. Hence, the proposed method may
   be an advantageous alternative to the other three strategies. IOS is
   implemented in MATLAB language and is available at

Volume = {5},

Abstract = {The suffix tree is a data structure for indexing strings. It is used in
   a variety of applications such as bioinformatics, time series analysis,
   clustering, text editing and data compression. However, when the string
   and the resulting suffix tree are too large to fit into the main memory,
   most existing construction algorithms become very inefficient.
   This paper presents a disk-based suffix tree construction method, called
   Elastic Range (ERa), which works efficiently with very long strings that
   are much larger than the available memory. ERa partitions the tree
   construction process horizontally and vertically and minimizes I/Os by
   dynamically adjusting the horizontal partitions independently for each
   vertical partition, based on the evolving shape of the tree and the
   available memory. Where appropriate, ERa also groups vertical partitions
   together to amortize the I/O cost. We developed a serial version; a
   parallel version for shared-memory and shared-disk multi-core systems;
   and a parallel version for shared-nothing architectures. ERa indexes the
   entire human genome in 19 minutes on an ordinary desktop computer. For
   comparison, the fastest existing method needs 15 minutes using 1024 CPUs
   on an IBM BlueGene supercomputer.},

Abstract = {The technology of automatic document summarization is maturing and may
   provide a solution to the information overload problem. Nowadays,
   document summarization plays an important role in information retrieval.
   With a large volume of documents, presenting the user with a summary of
   each document greatly facilitates the task of finding the desired
   documents. Document summarization is a process of automatically creating
   a compressed version of a given document that provides useful
   information to users. and multi-document summarization is to produce a
   summary delivering the majority of information content from a set of
   documents about an explicit or implicit main topic. In our study we
   focus on sentence based extractive document summarization. We propose
   the generic document summarization method which is based on sentence
   clustering. The proposed approach is a continue sentence-clustering
   based extractive summarization methods, proposed in Alguliev

Abstract = {A new approach for segmentation and classification of polarimetric
   synthetic aperture radar (POLSAR) data is proposed based on spectral
   graph partitioning. Since automated analysis techniques are often
   challenged due to the noisy properties of POLSAR data, human experts are
   employed to aid in the interpretation of such data in an operational
   setting. Humans can improve the performance of segmentation and
   classification of POLSAR data, because their vision system can apply
   cognitive skills that are not easy to incorporate into an automated
   system. The motivation for this paper is to incorporate some of these
   human perceptual skills into the computer algorithms. A framework that
   has recently emerged in computer vision for solving grouping problems
   with perceptually plausible results-spectral graph partitioning-is
   customized for POLSAR data. Segmentation is performed using the contour
   information in a region-based setting with the aid of spatial proximity.
   This is followed by a classification step performed through graph
   partitioning based on similarities of the mean coherence matrices
   obtained for each segment. Using the proposed approach, the results
   achieved are superior to the Wishart classifier. Automated parameter
   selection procedures are under development. This framework also suggests
   a way to accommodate different representations of polarimetric data and
   combine them with other information sources (e. g., optical imagery and
   digital elevation models).},

Journal = {GIGASCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {7},

Month = {NOV 23},
Abstract = {Background: Amplicon sequencing on Illumina sequencing platforms
   leverages their deep sequencing and multiplexing capacity but is limited
   in genetic resolution due to short read lengths. While Oxford Nanopore
   or Pacific Biosciences sequencing platforms overcome this limitation,
   their application has been limited due to higher error rates or lower
   data output. Results: In this study, we introduce an amplicon sequencing
   workflow, i.e., NanoAmpli-Seq, that builds on the intramolecular-ligated
   nanopore consensus sequencing (INC-Seq) approach and demonstrate its
   application for full-length 16S rRNA gene sequencing. NanoAmpli-Seq
   includes vital improvements to the INC-Seq protocol that reduces sample
   processing time while significantly improving sequence accuracy. The
   developed protocol includes chopSeq software for fragmentation and read
   orientation correction of INC-Seq consensus reads while nanoClust
   algorithm was designed for read partitioning-based de novo clustering
   and within cluster consensus calling to obtain accurate full-length 16S
   rRNA gene sequences. Conclusions: NanoAmpli-Seq accurately estimates the
   diversity of tested mock communities with average consensus sequence
   accuracy of 99.5\% for 2D and 1D(2) sequencing on the nanopore
   sequencing platform. Nearly all residual errors in NanoAmpli-Seq
   sequences originate from deletions in homopolymer regions, indicating
   that homopolymer aware base calling or error correction may allow for
   sequencing accuracy comparable to short-read sequencing platforms.},

Title = {Iterative randomized irregular circular algorithm for proliferation rate
   estimation in brain tumor Ki-67 histology images},
Journal = {EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {48},
Pages = {111-129},
Month = {APR 15},
Abstract = {Proliferation rate estimation (PRE) is clinically performed from Ki-67
   histopathology images. As brain tumor tissues are very complex, accurate
   PRE determination requires manual cell counting that is tedious, time
   consuming and inherently inaccurate due to inter-personal variations.
   Therefore, pathologists usually determine the PRE based on their
   experience and visualization without actual counting. Automating PRE can
   substantially increase the efficiency and accuracy of pathologists'
   determination of PRE. In addition, developing a deterministic and
   reproducible proliferation rate value is crucial to reduce
   inter-observer variability. In this paper, a PRE Computer Aided
   Diagnosis (PRECAD) system has been developed to automate the
   determination of PRE from Ki-67 histopathology microscopic images for
   brain tumors. The process involves six steps: color space
   transformation, customized color modification, nuclei segmentation based
   on K-Means clustering, preprocessing the extracted cells, counting based
   on an iterative structured circle detection (IRIC) algorithm, and
   finally, calculating the PRE value. The proposed IRIC algorithm is able
   to detect irregular and overlapping cells by introducing dynamic
   initialization to the basic RCD method, dividing the entire image into
   partitions based on 8-neighbor connected components. We initiated a new
   selection method for determining a best circle candidate that yields a
   reduced probability of incorrectly detecting circles, and proposed a new
   technique for detecting irregular cells via a dynamic number of
   iterations that guarantees finding all the cells in a selected
   partition. Using the same innovations mentioned above, our proposed IRIC
   algorithm can also be used to detect irregular and two or more
   overlapping cells. The proposed PRECAD system achieved high accuracy, as
   determined by quantitative analysis of precision, recall and
   F-measurement test values of 97.8\%, 98.3\% and 98\% for blue cells and
   98.7\%, 98\% and 98.4\% for brown cells, respectively. Thus, our
   proposed PRECAD system is as reliable as a pathologist for estimating
   the proliferation rate, while also featuring inherent reproducibility.

Abstract = {The region-based association analysis has been proposed to capture the
   collective behavior of sets of variants by testing the association of
   each set instead of individual variants with the disease. Such an
   analysis typically involves a list of unphased multiple-locus genotypes
   with potentially sparse frequencies in cases and controls. To tackle the
   problem of the sparse distribution, a two-stage approach was proposed in
   literature: In the first stage, haplotypes are computationally inferred
   from genotypes, followed by a haplotype coclassification. In the second
   stage, the association analysis is performed on the inferred haplotype
   groups. If a haplotype is unevenly distributed between the case and
   control samples, this haplotype is labeled as a risk haplotype.
   Unfortunately, the in-silico reconstruction of haplotypes might produce
   a proportion of false haplotypes which hamper the detection of rare but
   true haplotypes. Here, to address the issue, we propose an alternative
   approach: In Stage 1, we cluster genotypes instead of inferred
   haplotypes and estimate the risk genotypes based on a finite mixture
   model. In Stage 2, we infer risk haplotypes from risk genotypes inferred
   from the previous stage. To estimate the finite mixture model, we
   propose an EM algorithm with a novel data partition-based
   initialization. The performance of the proposed procedure is assessed by
   simulation studies and a real data analysis. Compared to the existing
   multiple Z-test procedure, we find that the power of genome-wide
   association studies can be increased by using the proposed procedure.},

Title = {Use of different forms of symmetry and multi-objective optimization for
   automatic pixel classification in remote-sensing satellite imagery},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {31},
Number = {22},
Pages = {5751-5775},
Abstract = {In this paper, a new multi-objective (MO) fuzzy-clustering technique is
   developed for unsupervised land-cover classification in remote-sensing
   images. This technique automatically partitions the pixels in the
   spectral domain into several clusters. The new MO clustering algorithm
   uses the newly developed simulated-annealing-based multi-objective
   optimization technique (AMOSA) as the underlying optimization strategy.
   Centre-based cluster encoding is used. Each cluster is divided into
   several small hyperspherical sub-clusters, and the centres of all these
   small sub-clusters are encoded in a string to represent the whole
   cluster. For membership-value computation of points to different
   clusters, these sub-clusters are considered individually. However, for
   the purpose of objective-function evaluation, these sub-clusters are
   merged appropriately to form some variable number of whole clusters.
   Three objective functions, one reflecting the total compactness of the
   partitioning based on the Euclidean distance, one reflecting the total
   point-symmetrical compactness of the obtained partitioning and one
   reflecting the total line-symmetrical compactness of the obtained
   partitioning are considered here. These are optimized simultaneously
   using AMOSA in order to detect the appropriate number of clusters and
   the appropriate partitioning from remote-sensing image datasets. The
   point symmetry present in a particular partitioning is measured using a
   newly developed point-symmetry-based distance, whereas the line symmetry
   present in a particular partitioning is measured using a newly developed
   line-symmetry-based distance. Since AMOSA, as well as any other MO
   optimization technique, provides a set of Pareto-optimal solutions, a
   new method is also developed to determine a single solution from this
   set. Different land-cover regions in remote-sensing imagery have been
   classified using the proposed technique to establish its efficiency.
   Results are compared with those obtained by fuzzy C-means (FCM)
   clustering technique and a recently developed symmetry-based automatic
   clustering technique, the variable string length genetic point symmetry
   (VGAPS) technique, both qualitatively and quantitatively. Qualitative
   comparisons are also carried out with the segmentation results obtained
   by the mean-shift-based segmentation technique.},

Abstract = {In this paper we propose and study the problem of trajectory-driven
   influential billboard placement: given a set of billboards U (each with
   a location and a cost), a database of trajectories T and a budget L,
   find a set of billboards within the budget to influence the largest
   number of trajectories. One core challenge is to identify and reduce the
   overlap of the influence from different billboards to the same
   trajectories, while keeping the budget constraint into consideration. We
   show that this problem is NP-hard and present an enumeration based
   algorithm with (1 - 1/e) approximation ratio. However, the
   enumeration-based method is costly when vertical bar U vertical bar is
   large. By exploiting the locality property of billboards' influence, we
   propose a partition-based framework PartSel. PartSel partitions U into a
   set of small clusters, computes the locally influential billboards for
   each cluster, and merges them to generate the global solution. Since the
   local solutions can be obtained much more efficient than the global one,
   PartSel can reduce the computation cost greatly; meanwhile it achieves a
   non-trivial approximation ratio guarantee. Then we propose a LazyProbe
   method to further prune billboards with low marginal influence, while
   achieving the same approximation ratio as PartSel. Experiments on real
   datasets verify the efficiency and effectiveness of our methods.},

Abstract = {Deterministic blockmodelling is a well-established clustering method for
   both exploratory and confirmatory social network analysis seeking
   partitions of a set of actors so that actors within each cluster are
   similar with respect to their patterns of ties to other actors (or, in
   some cases, other objects when considering two-mode networks). Even
   though some of the historical foundations for certain types of
   blockmodelling stem from the psychological literature, applications of
   deterministic blockmodelling in psychological research are relatively
   rare. This scarcity is potentially attributable to three factors: a
   general unfamiliarity with relevant blockmodelling methods and
   applications; a lack of awareness of the value of partitioning network
   data for understanding group structures and processes; and the
   unavailability of such methods on software platforms familiar to most
   psychological researchers. To tackle the first two items, we provide a
   tutorial presenting a general framework for blockmodelling and describe
   two of the most important types of deterministic blockmodelling
   applications relevant to psychological research: structural balance
   partitioning and two-mode partitioning based on structural equivalence.
   To address the third problem, we developed a suite of software programs
   that are available as both Fortran executable files and compiled Fortran
   dynamic-link libraries that can be implemented in the R software system.
   We demonstrate these software programs using networks from the
   literature.},

Abstract = {Bug triaging is the process of prioritizing bugs based on their
   severity, frequency, and risk in order to be assigned to appropriate
   developers for validation and resolution. This article introduces a
   graph-based feature augmentation approach for enhancing bug triaging
   systems using machine learning. A new feature augmentation approach that
   utilizes graph partitioning based on neighborhood overlap is proposed.
   Neighborhood overlap is a quite effective approach for discovering
   relationships in social graphs. Terms of bug summaries are represented
   as nodes in a graph, which is then partitioned into clusters of terms.
   Terms in strong clusters are augmented to the original feature vectors
   of bug summaries based on the similarity between the terms in each
   cluster and a bug summary. We employed other techniques such as term
   frequency, term correlation, and topic modeling to identify latent terms
   and augment them to the original feature vectors of bug summaries.
   Consequently, we utilized frequency, correlation, and neighborhood
   overlap techniques to create another feature augmentation approach that
   enriches the feature vectors of bug summaries to use them for bug
   triaging. The new modified vectors are used to classify bug reports into
   different priorities. Bug Triage in this context is to correctly
   recognize the priority of new bugs. Several classification algorithms
   are tested using the proposed methods. Experimental results on a data
   set with Eclipse bug reports extracted from the Bugzilla tracking system
   have shown that our approach outperformed the existing bug triaging
   systems including modern techniques that utilize deep learning.},

Title = {Exploring the solution landscape enables more reliable network community
   detection},
Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW E},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {100},
Number = {5},
Month = {NOV 21},
Abstract = {To understand how a complex system is organized and functions,
   researchers often identify communities in the system's network of
   interactions. Because it is practically impossible to explore all
   solutions to guarantee the best one, many community-detection algorithms
   rely on multiple stochastic searches. But for a given combination of
   network and stochastic algorithms, how many searches are sufficient to
   find a solution that is good enough? The standard approach is to pick a
   reasonably large number of searches and select the network partition
   with the highest quality or derive a consensus solution based on all
   network partitions. However, if different partitions have similar
   qualities such that the solution landscape is degenerate, the single
   best partition may miss relevant information, and a consensus solution
   may blur complementary communities. Here we address this degeneracy
   problem with coarse-grained descriptions of the solution landscape. We
   cluster network partitions based on their similarity and suggest an
   approach to determine the minimum number of searches required to
   describe the solution landscape adequately. To make good use of all
   partitions, we also propose different ways to explore the solution
   landscape, including a significance clustering procedure. We test these
   approaches on synthetic networks and a real-world network using two
   contrasting community-detection algorithms: The algorithm that can
   identify more general structures requires more searches, and networks
   with clearer community structures require fewer searches. We also find
   that exploring the coarse-grained solution landscape can reveal
   complementary solutions and enable more reliable community detection.},

   solve an image segmentation problem. To this end, various fusion-based
   segmentation approaches which use consensus clustering, and which are
   based on the optimization of a single criterion, have been proposed. One
   of the greatest challenges with these approaches is to select the best
   fusion criterion, which gives the best performance for the image
   segmentation model. In this paper, we propose a new fusion model of
   image segmentation based on multi-objective optimization, which aims to
   overcome the limitation and bias caused by a single criterion, and to
   provide a final improved segmentation. To address the ill-posedness for
   the search of the best criterion, the proposed fusion model combines two
   conflicting and complementary criteria for segmentation fusion, namely,
   the region-based variation of information (Vol) criterion and the
   contour-based F-measure (precision-recall) criterion using an
   entropy-based confidence weighting factor. To optimize our energy-based
   model, we propose an extended local optimization procedure based on
   superpixels and derived from the iterative conditional mode (ICM)
   algorithm. This new multi objective median partition-based approach,
   which relies on the fusion of inaccurate, quick and spatial clustering
   results, has emerged as an appealing alternative to the use of
   traditional segmentation fusion models which exist in the literature. We
   perform experiments using the Berkeley database with manual ground truth
   segmentations, and the results clearly show the feasibility and
   efficiency of the proposed methodology. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {Three Turano-European species of the Temnothorax interruptus group

Abstract = {The ant genus Temnothorax is very diverse in the Palaearctic region. It
   consists of many cryptic species which are hard to discover with
   conventional toolkits of alpha taxonomy. However, the modern,
   quantitative morphological approaches have been improved, and their
   increased accuracy and taxonomic specificity allow taxonomists to
   discover cryptic biological diversity on a much finer scale. In this
   paper, we provide quantitative morphology-based evidence in support of
   our contention that the Turano-European Temnothorax interruptus
   (SCHENCK, 1852) is, in fact, a complex of three clearly separable
   lineages. Species hypotheses are developed through NC-PART clustering, a
   highly automated protocol using two algorithms, NC-clustering and
   Partitioning Based on Recursive Thresholding (PART). Our results are
   based on a large dataset generated from 19 continuous morphometric
   traits measured on a total of 165 workers from 66 nest samples.
   Classifications returned by the exploratory analyses are confirmed by
   cross-validated Linear Discriminant Analysis (LOOCV-LDA) with a 0.6\%
   error rate in 166 workers. Two known type series, Temnothorax
   interruptus (SCHENCK, 1852) and Leptothorax tuberum ssp. knipovitshi
   KARAVAIEV, 1916, which meet the criteria for this species complex, are
   nested in the same cluster, and each classification is supported with
   posterior p = 1.0. Therefore, Leptothorax tuberum ssp. knipovitshi is
   considered a junior synonym of T. interruptus. The two other
   morphological clusters are described as T morea sp.n. and T strymonensis
   sp.n. Syntopic occurrence has been found in only one case, between
   Temnothorax interruptus and T strymonensis, and mixed colonies were not
   observed. Temnothorax interruptus has been identified as a
   Turano-European species, with distribution from Spain to the Caucasus
   but completely unknown in the Mediterranean region. The two broadly
   sympatric East Mediterranean species, T morea and T strymonensis, occur
   widely in the region from Croatia to Turkey.},

Abstract = {Characterization of glycemic patterns in individuals with type 1
   diabetes is addressed in this work. Unlike other methodologies, no
   insulin or meal data will be considered available. This makes the method
   presented suitable for all CGM users, independently of the insulin
   delivery device used. As well, no manual input is required from the
   patient potentially increasing usability and adherence.
   Data of 44 type 1 diabetic patients, from 26-week study were used in
   this work. An unsupervised clustering algorithm based on Fuzzy C-Means
   was applied to classify event-to-event segments of CGM data. Events
   defining data partitioning were automatically generated based on: (1) an
   automatic meal detection algorithm (for day periods) and (2) time of day
   (for night periods). After pre-filtering the dataset, 985 meal segments
   were detected and 180 periods were labelled as night per patient on
   average. The optimal number of clusters was determined by optimising
   clusters' compactness and separation metrics, as given by the
   Fukuyama-Sugeno index. An average of 8 clusters for postprandial
   segments and 5 for nights was obtained, although, depending on patients'
   habits and the amount of training data, these numbers may vary between
   patients. For the sake of comparison, the method was also applied to CGM
   data partitioned based on the mealtime manually reported by the patient.
   The use of a meal detection algorithm instead proved superior
   performance in terms of reduced within-cluster variability and
   interpretation of the resulting prototypes, besides freeing from patient
   intervention.
   Clusters described CGM data segments with differentiated glycemic
   control metrics, such as time in range (TIR), with average values across
   all patients of 45.2 +/- 15 \% (mean +/- SD) for detected meals and 49.9
   +/- 13.6 \% for announced meals data.},

Abstract = {In vehicular edge computing (VEC), the execution of offloading task
   needs not only the task data uploaded by the requesting vehicle, but
   also the additional data to support the task to be executed
   successfully, and how to efficiently cache and access these supporting
   data becomes the key issue for task offloading in VEC. In this paper, we
   study the efficient caching mechanism to minimize the acquisition delay
   of the supporting data. Firstly, with the software defined network (SDN)
   based VEC framework, we analyze the acquisition ways of the supporting
   data and the caching collaboration between VEC servers. Then, according
   to the density of the requesting vehicles, we divide the VEC coverage
   into dense and ordinary areas. With the consideration of the similarity
   of the requested data and the distance between edge servers, the edge
   servers are clustered into multiple groups based on K-mean++ algorithm.
   Finally, each server's storage space is divided into three partitions,
   and the most beneficial data for itself, its group and the whole system
   are respectively stored in these partitions. Based on service area
   dividing, server grouping and storage space partitioning, we propose an
   efficient edge-cloud collaborative caching strategy, which can reduce
   the delay of data migration while task execution. Simulation results
   show that, compared with other schemes, the proposed caching strategy
   has better performance in terms of average data migration delay and
   application QoS.},

Abstract = {Short-term traffic forecasting is important for the development of an
   intelligent traffic management system. Critical to the performance of
   the traffic prediction model utilized in such a system is accurate
   representation of the spatiotemporal traffic characteristics. This can
   be achieved by integrating spatiotemporal traffic information or the
   dynamic traffic characteristics in the modeling process. The currently
   employed spatiotemporal k-nearest neighbor (STKNN) model is based on the
   spatial heterogeneity and adaptive spatiotemporal parameters of the
   traffic to improve the prediction accuracy. However, the non-stationary
   characteristics of the traffic cannot be fully represented by simply
   modeling the entire time range or all the time partitions based on
   experience. We therefore developed a dynamic STKNN model (D-STKNN) for
   short-term traffic forecasting based on the non-stationary
   spatiotemporal pattern of the road traffic. The different traffic
   patterns along the road are first automatically determined using an
   affinity propagation clustering algorithm. The Warped K-Means algorithm
   is then used to automatically partition the time periods for each
   traffic pattern. Finally, the D-STKNN model is developed based on the
   three-dimensional spatiotemporal tensor data models for the different
   road segments with different traffic patterns during different time
   periods. The D-STKNN model was verified through extensive experiments
   performed using actual vehicular speed datasets collected from city
   roads in Beijing, China, and expressways in California, U.S.A. The
   proposed model outperforms existing seven baselines in different time
   periods under different traffic patterns. The results confirmed the
   imperative of considering the non-stationary spatiotemporal traffic
   pattern in developing a model for short-term traffic prediction.},

Journal = {INFORMATION PROCESSING \& MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {42},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {Compressing an inverted file can greatly improve query performance of an
   information retrieval system (IRS) by reducing disk I/Os. We observe
   that a good document identifier assignment (DIA) can make the document
   identifiers in the posting lists more clustered, and result in better
   compression as well as shorter query processing time. In this paper, we
   tackle the NP-complete problem of finding an optimal DIA to minimize the
   average query processing time in an IRS when the probability
   distribution of query terms is given. We indicate that the greedy
   nearest neighbor (Greedy-NN) algorithm can provide excellent performance
   for this problem. However, the Greedy-NN algorithm is inappropriate if
   used in large-scale IRSs, due to its high complexity O(N-2 x n), where N
   denotes the number of documents and n denotes the number of distinct
   terms. In real-world IRSs, the distribution of query terms is skewed.
   Based on this fact, we propose a fast O(N x n) heuristic, called
   partition-based document identifier assignment (PBDIA) algorithm, which
   can efficiently assign consecutive document identifiers to those
   documents containing frequently used query terms, and improve
   compression efficiency of the posting lists for those terms. This can
   result in reduced query processing time. The experimental results show
   that the PBDIA algorithm can yield a competitive performance versus the
   Greedy-NN for the DIA problem, and that this optimization problem has
   significant advantages for both long queries and parallel information
   retrieval (IR). (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {In this article, we propose and study the problem of trajectory-driven
   influential billboard placement: given a set of billboardsU (each with a
   location and a cost), a database of trajectories T, and a budget L, we
   find a set of billboards within the budget to influence the largest
   number of trajectories. One core challenge is to identify and reduce the
   overlap of the influence from different billboards to the same
   trajectories, while keeping the budget constraint into consideration. We
   show that this problem is NP-hard and present an enumeration based
   algorithm with (1 - 1/e) approximation ratio. However, the enumeration
   would be very costly when vertical bar U vertical bar is large. By
   exploiting the locality property of billboards' influence, we propose a
   partition-based framework PartSel. PartSel partitions U into a set of
   small clusters, computes the locally influential billboards for each
   cluster, and merges them to generate the global solution. Since the
   local solutions can be obtained much more efficiently than the global
   one, PartSel would reduce the computation cost greatly; meanwhile it
   achieves a non-trivial approximation ratio guarantee. Then we propose a
   LazyProbe method to further prune billboards with low marginal
   influence, while achieving the same approximation ratio as PartSel.
   Next, we propose a branch-and-bound method to eliminate unnecessary
   enumerations in both PartSel and LazyProbe, as well as an aggregated
   index to speed up the computation of marginal influence. Experiments on
   real datasets verify the efficiency and effectiveness of our methods.},

Abstract = {The M-based hierarchy cardinalities of spin irreps for {[}A] ((Ii =
   1))/(20) uniform nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) /isotopomer spin
   ensembles are derived. Such ideas define the completeness of the
   number-partition-based (intermediate) combinatorial designs (on M)
   themselves inherent in specific lambda l- n digit assembly combinatorial
   properties. Illustrative M-subspatial irrep subsets are derived via
   Schur decompositions from symbolic algorithms (Sagan, B. E. Symmetric
   Group: Representations, C-Algorithms, Symmetric Functions; Wadsworth:
   Belmont, CA, 1991; SYMMETRICA package, as per Kerber, A.; Kohnert, A.;
   Lascoux,A. Symbolic Comput 1992, 14, 195). The results are discussed in
   the context of the independant cardinality of underlying system scalar
   invariants (SI) corresponding to the democratic auxiliary labels (Chem
   Phys 1998, 238, 245; J Math Chem in-press) or projective recoupling, of
   20-fold dual tensorial sets. Landau-like S-n-maps for fundamental terms
   plus statistical weighted subsidary maps yield the independent
   \textbackslash{}SIs\textbackslash{} (see Europhys Lett in press).
   Geometric aspects of the dual group mappings imply that eventually large
   cage NMR ensembles must be governed by a local, rather than a global,
   symmetry, with the former related to established spectral deceptive NMR.
   This suggests a further role for dynamical networks in NMR, beyond that

Title = {Graph-based determination of structural controllability and

   steam-assisted gravity drainage operation},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PROCESS CONTROL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {86},
Pages = {65-80},

Abstract = {Steam assisted gravity drainage (SAGD), which is used for the in-situ
   extraction and recovery of oil sands bitumen, is represented by a
   distributed parameter system (DPS). The problem of sensor placement and
   the control of steam chamber growth and oil production, respectively,
   require analysis of the observability and controllability of the system.
   In this type of system, parametric sensitivity is traditionally used in
   lieu of observability, and controllability has not been explored
   rigorously. In this work, we analyze the pressure and temperature fields
   of a SAGD model based on detailed reservoir simulations and present a
   data-driven technique to assess the structural controllability and
   observability of the system, with a view to determine optimal locations
   of actuators and sensors. An agglomerative hierarchical clustering
   technique is used to obtain a spanning tree of the clusters which is
   partitioned based on an objective function to arrive at a set of
   spatially contiguous clusters that display similar pressure/temperature
   dynamics. A Granger causality measure is used to create the linkage
   amongst the clusters to build a digraph model of the data. The driver
   nodes of the graph identify locations for actuation which provide full
   control over the graph, and the root strongly connected components
   indicate sensor locations which ensure structural observability over the
   entire graph. We demonstrate the method using data generated from SAGD
   simulations using the CMG-STARS simulator, identify the sensor and
   actuator locations required for complete structural observability and
   controllability of the system, and also provide a method of assessment
   of partial actuation and in-sensor ranges. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {With the start of big data era, data stream computing has emerged as a
   well-known approach to optimize data-intensive workflows. Apache STORM
   is an open-source real-time distributed computation system for
   processing data streams and has been opted by famous organizations such
   as Twitter, Yahoo, Alibaba, Baidu, Groupon. The workflows are
   implemented as topologies in STORM. The main aspect that controls the
   execution performance of a workflow in STORM is the strategy of
   scheduling the topology components (spout and bolts). In this paper, we
   evaluate and analyze the performance of our algorithm Partition-based
   Data-intensive Workflow optimization Algorithm (PDWA) in Apache STORM
   using a use case workflow, EURExpressII. It is a real-world
   application-based workflow that builds a transcriptome-wide atlas of
   gene expression for the developing mouse embryo established by
   ribonucleic acid (RNA) in situ hybridization. Our proposed algorithm,
   PDWA, partitions the application task graph so that the data movement
   between partitions is minimum. Each partition is then mapped on one
   machine for the execution of tasks of that partition. It provides
   minimum execution time for that particular partition. Partial task
   duplication is also part of this algorithm that enhances the
   performance. A STORM-based computing cluster is developed in OpenStack
   cloud which is used as a computing environment. The performance of
   PDWA-based optimizer is evaluated with the data sets of different sizes.
   The achieved results show that PDWA performs with 21\% improved average
   execution time for different sizes of data sets and varying execution
   nodes. In addition, the comparative results show that on average the
   efficiency of PDWA is 20.4\% higher as compared to STORM default
   scheduler (SDS).},

Title = {K-VARP: K-anonymity for varied data streams via partitioning},
Journal = {INFORMATION SCIENCES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {467},
Pages = {238-255},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The Internet-of-Things (IoT) produces and transmits enormous amounts of
   data. Extracting valuable information from this enormous volume of data
   has become an important consideration for businesses and research.
   However, extracting information from this data without providing privacy
   protection puts individuals at risk. Data has to be sanitized before
   use, and anonymization provides solution to this problem. Since, IoT is
   a collection of numerous different devices, data streams from these
   devices tend to vary over time thus creating varied data streams.
   However, implementing traditional data stream anonymization approaches
   only provide privacy protection for data streams that have predefined
   and fixed attributes. Therefore, conventional methods cannot directly
   work on varied data streams. In this work, we propose K-VARP
   (K-anonymity for VARied data stream via Partitioning) to publish varied
   data streams. K-VARP reads the tuple and assigns them to partitions
   based on description, and all tuples must be anonymized before expiring.
   It tries to anonymize expiring tuple within a partition if its partition
   is eligible to produce a K-anonymous cluster. Otherwise, partition
   merging is applied. In K-VARP we propose a new merging criterion called
   R-likeness to measure similarity distance between tuple and partitions.
   Moreover, flexible re-using and imputation free-publication is implied
   in K-VARP to achieve better anonymization quality and performance. Our
   experiments on a real datasets show that K-VARP is efficient and
   effective compared to existing algorithms. K-VARP demonstrated
   approximately three to nine and ten to twenty percent less information
   loss on two real datasets, while forming a similar number of clusters
   within a comparable computation time. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {Since the last two decades, the use of laser scanners for generating
   accurate and dense 3D models has been rapidly growing in multiple
   disciplines. The reliance on human-expertise to perform an efficient
   scanning in terms of completeness and quality encouraged the researchers
   to develop strategies for carrying out an optimized and automated scan
   planning. Nevertheless, due to the predominant use of static terrestrial
   laser scanners (TLS), the most of developed methods have been focused on
   scan optimization by fixing standpoints on basis of static scanning. The
   increasing use of portable mobile laser scanning systems (MLS) enables
   faster non-stop acquisition which demands the planning of optimal scan
   trajectories. Therefore, a novel method addressing the absence of
   dynamic scan planning is proposed considering specific MLS constraints
   such as maximum acquisition time or closed-loops requirement. First, an
   initial analysis is carried out to determinate key-positions to reach
   during data acquisition. From these positions a navigable graph is
   generated to compute routes satisfying specific MLS constraints by a
   three-step process. This starts by estimating the number of routes
   necessary to subsequently carry out a coarse graph partition based on
   Kmedoids clustering. Next, a balancing algorithm was implemented to
   compute a balanced graph partition by node exchanging. Finally,
   partitions are extended by adding key nodes from their adjacent ones in
   order to provide a desirable overlapping between scans. The method was
   tested by simulating three laser scanner configurations in four indoor
   and outdoor real case studies. The acquisition quality of the computed
   scan planning was evaluated in terms of 3D completeness and point cloud
   density with the simulator Helios++.},

Title = {A distributed computing model for big data anonymization in the networks},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {18},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR 28},
Abstract = {Recently big data and its applications had sharp growth in various
   fields such as IoT, bioinformatics, eCommerce, and social media. The
   huge volume of data incurred enormous challenges to the architecture,
   infrastructure, and computing capacity of IT systems. Therefore, the
   compelling need of the scientific and industrial community is
   large-scale and robust computing systems. Since one of the
   characteristics of big data is value, data should be published for
   analysts to extract useful patterns from them. However, data publishing
   may lead to the disclosure of individuals' private information. Among
   the modern parallel computing platforms, Apache Spark is a fast and
   in-memory computing framework for large-scale data processing that
   provides high scalability by introducing the resilient distributed
   dataset (RDDs). In terms of performance, Due to in-memory computations,
   it is 100 times faster than Hadoop. Therefore, Apache Spark is one of
   the essential frameworks to implement distributed methods for
   privacy-preserving in big data publishing (PPBDP). This paper uses the
   RDD programming of Apache Spark to propose an efficient parallel
   implementation of a new computing model for big data anonymization. This
   computing model has three-phase of in-memory computations to address the
   runtime, scalability, and performance of large-scale data anonymization.
   The model supports partition-based data clustering algorithms to
   preserve the lambda-diversity privacy model by using transformation and
   actions on RDDs. Therefore, the authors have investigated Spark-based
   implementation for preserving the lambda-diversity privacy model by two
   designed City block and Pearson distance functions. The results of the
   paper provide a comprehensive guideline allowing the researchers to
   apply Apache Spark in their own researches.},

Abstract = {The main purpose of stereo vision analysis is to recover the range
   (depth) information of objects in a three-dimensional (3D) scene based
   on a binocular image pair taken from two distinct views. Stereo matching
   (correspondence) is the key step in stereo vision analysis. There exist
   two general types of stereo matching, namely, intensity-based
   (area-based) matching and feature-based matching. In this study, by the
   use of the idea of searching relational graphs, a dynamic programming
   approach to line segment (feature-based) matching in stereo vision is
   proposed. Incorporating the divide-and-conquer strategy and the feature
   stability concept, the proposed approach is simple, but effective, as
   compared with the other existing approaches. In the proposed approach,
   by the use of the divide-and-conquer strategy, the line segments in the
   left image L are first partitioned, based on their orientations, into
   two sets: L(nh) (nonhorizontal) and L(h) (nearly horizontal), and then
   the nonhorizontal line segments in L(nh) and their potential matching
   line segments in the right image R are clustered into K similar groups,
   L(nh)(k) and R(nh)(k), k = 1, 2,..., K, respectively. The stereo
   matchings of the nonhorizontal line segments between L(nh)(k) and
   R(nh)(k) are determined by finding the maximal weighted path on the
   associated potential matching multistage graph PMMG. And by the use of
   the feature stability concept, the stereo matchings of the nearly
   horizontal line segments in L(h) are similarly determined based on the
   structural relationships between the matched nonhorizontal line segments
   and the nearly horizontal line segments. Some experimental results show
   the feasibility of the proposed approach.},

Title = {FAAD: an unsupervised fast and accurate anomaly detection method for a
   multi-dimensional sequence over data stream},

Abstract = {Recently, sequence anomaly detection has been widely used in many
   fields. Sequence data in these fields are usually multi-dimensional over
   the data stream. It is a challenge to design an anomaly detection method
   for a multi-dimensional sequence over the data stream to satisfy the
   requirements of accuracy and high speed. It is because: (1) Redundant
   dimensions in sequence data and large state space lead to a poor ability
   for sequence modeling; (2) Anomaly detection cannot adapt to the
   high-speed nature of the data stream, especially when concept drift
   occurs, and it will reduce the detection rate. On one hand, most
   existing methods of sequence anomaly detection focus on the
   single-dimension sequence. On the other hand, some studies concerning
   multi-dimensional sequence concentrate mainly on the static database
   rather than the data stream. To improve the performance of anomaly
   detection for a multi-dimensional sequence over the data stream, we
   propose a novel unsupervised fast and accurate anomaly detection (FAAD)
   method which includes three algorithms. First, a method called
   ``information calculation and minimum spanning tree cluster{''} is
   adopted to reduce redundant dimensions. Second, to speed up model
   construction and ensure the detection rate for the sequence over the
   data stream, we propose a method called ``random sampling and
   subsequence partitioning based on the index probabilistic suffix
   tree.{''} Last, the method called ``anomaly buffer based on model
   dynamic adjustment{''} dramatically reduces the effects of concept drift
   in the data stream. FAAD is implemented on the streaming platform Storm
   to detect multi-dimensional log audit data. Compared with the existing
   anomaly detection methods, FAAD has a good performance in detection rate
   and speed without being affected by concept drift.},

Abstract = {As laser scanning technology improves and costs are coming down, the
   amount of point cloud data being generated can be prohibitively
   difficult and expensive to process on a single machine. This data
   explosion is not only limited to point cloud data. Voluminous amounts of
   high-dimensionality and quickly accumulating data, collectively known as
   Big Data, such as those generated by social media, Internet of Things
   devices and commercial transactions, are becoming more prevalent as
   well. New computing paradigms and frameworks are being developed to
   efficiently handle the processing of Big Data, many of which utilize a
   compute cluster composed of several commodity grade machines to process
   chunks of data in parallel.
   A central concept in many of these frameworks is data locality. By its
   nature, Big Data is large enough that the entire dataset would not fit
   on the memory and hard drives of a single node hence replicating the
   entire dataset to each worker node is impractical. The data must then be
   partitioned across worker nodes in a manner that minimises data transfer
   across the network. This is a challenge for point cloud data because
   there exist different ways to partition data and they may require data
   transfer.
   We propose a partitioning based on Z-order which is a form of
   locality-sensitive hashing. The Z-order or Morton code is computed by
   dividing each dimension to form a grid then interleaving the binary
   representation of each dimension. For example, the Z-order code for the
   grid square with coordinates (x = 1 = 01(2), y = 3 = 11(2)) is 1011(2) =
   11. The number of points in each partition is controlled by the number
   of bits per dimension: the more bits, the fewer the points. The number
   of bits per dimension also controls the level of detail with more bits
   yielding finer partitioning. We present this partitioning method by
   implementing it on Apache Spark and investigating how different
   parameters affect the accuracy and running time of the k nearest
   neighbour algorithm for a hemispherical and a triangular wave point
   cloud.},

Abstract = {The solution of using existing WiFi devices for measurement and
   maintenance, and establishing a WiFi fingerprint database for precise
   localization has become a popular method for indoor localization. The
   traditional WiFi fingerprint privacy protection scheme increases the
   calculation amount of the client, but cannot completely protect the
   security of the client and the fingerprint database. In this paper, we
   make use of WiFi devices to present a Practical Privacy Protection
   Scheme In WiFi Fingerprint-based Localization PPWFL. In PPWFL, the
   localization server establishes a pre-partition in the fingerprint
   database through the E-M clustering algorithm, we divide the entire
   fingerprint database into several partitions. The server uses WiFi
   fingerprint entries with partitions as training data and trains a
   machine learning model. This model can accurately predict the client's
   partition based on fingerprint entries. The client uses the trained
   machine learning model to obtain its partition location accurately,
   picks up WiFi fingerprint entries in its partition, and calculates its
   geographic location with the localization server through secure
   multi-party computing. Compared with the traditional solution, our
   solution only uses the WiFi fingerprint entries in the client's
   partition rather than the entire fingerprint database. PPWFL can reduce
   not only unnecessary calculations but also avoid accidental errors
   (Unexpected errors in fingerprint similarity between non-adjacent
   locations due to multipath effects of electromagnetic waves during the
   propagation of complex indoor environments) in fingerprint distance
   calculation. In particular, due to the use of Secure Multi-Party
   Computation, most of the calculations are performed in the local offline
   phase, the client only exchanges data with the localization server
   during the distance calculation phase. No additional equipment is
   needed; our solution uses only existing WiFi devices in the building to
   achieve fast localization based on privacy protection. We prove that
   PPWFL is secure under the honest but curious attacker. Experiments show
   that PPWFL achieves efficiency and accuracy than the traditional WiFi
   fingerprint localization scheme.},

Title = {Interaction between high-level and low-level image analysis for semantic

Abstract = {The task of extracting a semantic video object is split into two
   subproblems, namely, object segmentation and region segmentation. Object
   segmentation relies on a priori assumptions, whereas region segmentation
   is data-driven and can be solved in an automatic manner. These two
   subproblems are not mutually independent, and they can benefit from
   interactions with each other. In this paper, a framework for such
   interaction is formulated. This representation scheme based on region
   segmentation and semantic segmentation is compatible with the view that
   image analysis and scene understanding problems can be decomposed into
   low-level and high-level tasks. Low-level tasks pertain to
   region-oriented processing, whereas the high-level tasks are closely
   related to object-level processing. This approach emulates the human
   visual system: what one ``sees{''} in a scene depends on the scene
   itself (region segmentation) as well as on the cognitive task (semantic
   segmentation) at hand. The higher-level segmentation results in a
   partition corresponding to semantic video objects. Semantic video
   objects do not usually have invariant physical properties and the
   definition depends on the application. Hence, the definition
   incorporates complex domain-specific knowledge and is not easy to
   generalize. For the specific implementation used in this paper, motion
   is used as a clue to semantic information. In this framework, an
   automatic algorithm is presented for computing the semantic partition
   based on color change detection. The change detection strategy is
   designed to be immune to the sensor noise and local illumination
   variations. The lower-level segmentation identifies the partition
   corresponding to perceptually uniform regions. These regions are derived
   by clustering in an N-dimensional feature space, composed of static as
   well as dynamic image attributes. We propose an interaction mechanism
   between the semantic and the region partitions which allows to cope with
   multiple simultaneous objects. Experimental results show that the
   proposed method extracts semantic video objects with high spatial
   accuracy and temporal coherence.},

Abstract = {As the current calculation method of voltage/var sensitivity (VVS) could
   not reflect the temporal variations of power sources and load, the paper
   proposes a novel VVS calculation method to partition the distribution
   network containing renewable energy. Firstly, the defects of the
   existing VVS calculation methods are analyzed, and a novel VVS
   calculation method is proposed by adding reactive power output
   perturbation to the reactive power source. Secondly, the VVS matrix is
   fuzzified to obtain the membership matrix between each node. Based on
   the membership relationship between the reactive power source nodes, the
   nodes with a strong coupling relationship are merged to determine the
   initial number of partitioning. Then, the final partitioning result is
   determined according to the affiliation between each load node and each
   reactive power source. Finally, the partitioning result is evaluated
   based on the partitioning membership indexes. The proposed approach is
   tested on the IEEE 33-node distribution test system, and numerical
   simulations verify the high efficiency of partitioning. The simulation
   results show that the proposed method can reflect the temporal
   variations of power sources and load, and ensure the reasonable
   distribution of voltage and reactive power in each zone. Background The
   voltage/var control of the power system is an important means to ensure
   the safe, economic and stable operation of the system. Objective The
   paper proposes a novel VVS calculation method to partition the
   distribution network containing renewable energy. Methods Firstly, the
   existing problems of electrical distance index are analyzed. A novel VVS
   matrix calculation method is proposed, which calculates the VVS of each
   reactive power source to the remaining nodes by adding voltage/var
   output perturbation to the reactive power source. Secondly, the VVS
   matrix is fuzzified to obtain the membership matrix between each node.
   Based on the membership relationship between the reactive power source
   nodes, the power supply nodes with strong coupling relationship are
   merged to determine the initial number of the partitioning. Then, the
   final partitioning result is determined according to the affiliation
   between each load node and each reactive power source. Finally, the
   partitioning result is evaluated based on the sensitivity index of
   membership degree. Results The proposed approach is tested on the IEEE
   33-node distribution test system and numerical simulations verify high
   efficiency of the partitioning. The simulation results show that the
   proposed method can reflect the temporal variations of power sources and
   load, and ensure the reasonable distribution of voltage and reactive
   power in each zone. Conclusion The proposed method can reflect the
   temporal variations of power sources and load, and ensure the reasonable
   distribution of voltage and reactive power in each zone. This paper
   proposed a fuzzy clustering partitioning based on a novel calculation
   method of VVS, which is suitable for the problem of variable voltage
